<p class="cap">My retirement from official duties as
President has enabled me to restore
order on my plantations, and in some degree
to repair the neglected buildings which are
fallen to decay. The constant coming of
guests—moved, I fear, more by curiosity
than by other reasons—is diminished owing
to snows, unusual at this period of the year.</p>

<p>Owing to these favouring conditions, I
have now some small leisure to reflect on
a life which has been too much one of action
and of public interests to admit, hitherto, of
that kind of retrospection which is natural,
and, as it seems to me, fitting in a man of my
years, who has little to look forward to and
much to look back upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>My recent uneasiness lest I should be
called upon to conduct a war against our
old allies, the French, is much abated, and
I feel more free to consider my private
affairs. I am too far advanced in the vale
of life to bear much buffeting, and I have
satisfaction in the belief we have escaped
a new war for which the nation has not yet
the strength. For sure I am, if this country
is preserved in tranquillity twenty years
longer, it may bid defiance in a just cause
to any powers whatever, such in that time
will be its power, wealth, and resources.</p>

<p>Increasing infirmity and too frequent
aches and ailments remind me that I am
nearing the awful moment when I must
bid adieu to sublunary things, and appear
before that Divine Being to whom alone
my country owes the success with which we
have been blessed. But the great Disposer
of events is also the Being who has formed
the instruments of his will and left them responsible
to the arbitration of conscience.
Therefore I have of late spent much time in
considering my past life, and how it might
have been better or more successful, and in
thankfulness that it has escaped many pitfalls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>My reflections have brought back to mind
a remark which seems to me just, made by
my aide, Colonel Tilghman, a man more
given to philosophic reflection than I have
been. He asked me if I did not think there
was something providential in the way each
period of my life had been an education for
that which followed it. I said that this idea
had at times presented itself to my mind,
and when I betrayed curiosity, he went on
to say that my very early education in self-reliance
and my training as a surveyor of
wild lands had fitted me for frontier warfare,
that this in turn had prepared me
for action on a larger stage, and that
all through the greater war my necessities
called for constant dealing with political
questions, and with men who were not soldiers.
He thought that this had in turn
educated me for the position to which
my countrymen summoned me at a later
time.</p>

<p>As I was silent for a little, this gentleman,
who became my aide-de-camp in June, 1780,
and for whom I conceived a warm and lasting
affection, thinking his remark might
have been considered a liberty, said as much,
excusing himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>I replied that, so far from annoying me,
I found what he had to say interesting.</p>

<p>When, recently, these remarks of Colonel
Tilghman recurred to me, I felt that
they were correct, and dwelling upon them
at this remote time, my interest in the sequence
of the events of my youthful life
assumed an importance which has led me
of late to endeavour, with the aid of my
diaries, to refresh my memories of a past
which had long ceased to engage my attention.</p>

<p>I remember writing once that any recollections
of my later life, distinct from the
general history of the war, would rather
hurt my feelings than tickle my pride while
I lived. I do not think vanity is a trait of
my character. I would rather leave posterity
to think and say what they please of
me. Those who served with me in war and
peace will be judged as we become subjects
of history, and time may unfold more
than prudence ought to disclose. Concerning
this matter I wrote to Colonel Humphreys
that if I had talent for what he
desired me to do, I had not leisure to turn
my thoughts to commentaries. Consciousness
of a defective education, and want of
leisure, I thought, unfitted me for such an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
undertaking. I did, however, answer certain
questions put to me by Colonel Humphreys
concerning the Indian wars, but he
has, so far, made no use of these notes.</p>

<p>One of these considerations does not so
much apply at present, for I possess the
leisure, and in recording my early reminiscences
I shall do so for myself alone, and
assuredly shall find no satisfaction in comments
on the conduct of other officers who,
like myself, were honestly engaged in learning,
and at the same time practising, a business
in which none of us had a large
experience. I shall confine my attention
to recalling the events of my youth, and
as I hate deception even where the imagination
only is concerned, I shall try, for
my own satisfaction, to deal merely with
facts. General Hamilton, whose remarks
I have often just reason to remember, once
wrote me that no man had ever written a
true biography of himself, that he was apt
to blame himself excessively or to be too
much prone to self-defence. He went on
to state that an autobiography was written
either from vanity and to present the man
favourably to posterity, or because he desired
for his own pleasure in the study of
himself to recall the events of his career.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
In the latter case there is no need of publication.</p>

<p>It is only in order to such self-examination
as that to which he refers that I am
induced to set down the remembrances of
my earlier days, and because writing of
them will, I feel, enable me more surely to
bring them back to mind. I have no other
motive.</p>

<p>Whatever just ambitions I have had have
been fully gratified; indeed, far beyond my
wishes. The great Searcher of hearts is my
witness that I have now no wish which
aspires beyond the humble and happy lot
of living and dying a private citizen on
my own farm. In my estimation, more
permanent and genuine happiness is to be
found in the sequestered walks of connubial
life, so long denied me in the war, than in
the more tumultuous and imposing scenes
of successful ambition. Nor can I complain.
I am retiring here within myself. Envious
of none, I am determined to be pleased with
all; and with heartfelt satisfaction, feeling
that my life has been on the whole happy, I
will move gently down the stream until I
sleep with my fathers.</p>

<p>There are indeed not many circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
in my life before the war which it now gives
me pain to recall. I could not truthfully say
this of that great contest, nor of the political
struggles of my service as President. Mr.
Adams, or perhaps Mr. Jefferson, once said
of me that I was a man too sensitive to condemnation.
This I believe to be correct, but
I have not discovered that my ability to decide
was ever largely affected by either unreasonable
blame or the bribes of flattery.</p>

<p>The treachery of men who professed for
me friendship, and the intrigues of those
who, like Conway, Lee, Gates, and Rush,
used ignoble means to weaken my authority
when it was of the utmost importance to our
common cause that it should be strengthened,
were calculated to give pain chiefly
because they lessened my usefulness. Nor
am I ever willing to dwell upon the treason
of Arnold, which cost me the most painful
duty of the war, and lost to the country a
great soldier, who had not the virtue to
wait until, in the course of events, his services
would obtain their reward. It is, however,
somewhat to be wondered at that in so
long a war, where hope did at times seem
to disappear, the catalogue of traitors was
so small. It is strange that there were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
more, for few men have virtue to withstand
the highest bidder. As to ill-natured and
unjust reflections on my conduct, I feel, and
have felt, everything that hurts the sensibility
of a gentleman, but to persevere in
one’s duty and be silent is the best answer
to calumny.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin has wisely said that no
examples are so useful to a man as those
which his own conduct affords, and that
he was right in his opinion I have reason
to believe. This I have observed to be true
of anger, to which I am, or was, subject.
I flatter myself that I have now learned to
command my temper, although it is still on
rare occasions likely to become mutinous. I
do not observe that mere abuse ever troubles
me long, but in the presence of cowardice
or ingratitude I am subject to fits of rage.</p>

<p>Arnold’s treason distressed me, but the
treachery of one of my cabinet, Edmund
Randolph, the nephew and adopted son of
my dear friend Peyton Randolph, disturbed
my temper as nothing had done since the
misconduct of Lee at Monmouth. If in any
instance I was swayed by personal and private
feelings in the exercise of official
patronage and power, it was in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Mr. Randolph; and this fact added to the
anger which his conduct excited.</p>

<p>I willingly turn from the remembrance
of ingratitude, a sin that my soul abhors.
It is a severe tax which all must occasionally
pay who are called to eminent stations
of trust, not only to be held up as conspicuous
marks to the enmity of the public
adversaries of their country, but to the
malice of secret traitors, and the envious
intrigues of false friends and factions. But
all this is over. I willingly leave time and
my country to pronounce the verdict of
history.</p>

<p>As I wrote what just now I have set down,
a remark of Mr. John Adams came into my
mind. He said it was difficult for a man to
write about himself without feeling that he
was all the time in the presence of an audience.
This may be true of Mr. Adams, but
I am not aware that it is true of me.</p>

<p>The statement I shall now record of
myself and for myself might be made very
full as to events by the use of the details
of my diaries, but this I desire to avoid. My
intention is to deal chiefly with my own
youthful life and the influences which affected
it for good or for ill.</p>

<p class="cap">Being without children to transmit my
name, I have taken no great interest in
learning much about my ancestors. I have,
indeed, been too much concerned with larger
matters. It is, however, far from my design
to believe that heraldry, coat-armour, etc.,
might not be rendered conducive to public
and private uses with us, or that they can
have any tendency unfriendly to the purest
spirit of republicanism; nor does it seem to
me that pride in being come of gentry and
of dutiful and upright men is without its
value, if we draw from an honourable past
nourishment to sustain us in continuing to
be what our forefathers were. This also
should make men who have children the
more careful as to their own manner of life,
and as for myself, although denied this
great blessing, I may perhaps wisely have
been destined to feel that all my countrymen
were to me something more than my
fellow-citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>I have heard my half-brother Lawrence
say that he had learned from his elders
that my English ancestors were violent
Loyalists, especially one Sir Henry Washington,
when the great struggle arose between
the Parliament and the King in the
time of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>I recall that, when a young man, I was
riding with my friend George Mason, and
when this matter arose, and he asked me
whether if I had lived in those days I should
have been for the crown or the commons, I
replied that if I had lived in that time I
could have answered him, but that I was not
enough informed concerning that period to
be able to state on which side I should have
been. Certainly I should have found it hard
to make war on the King.</p>

<p>I profess myself to be ignorant as to
much that concerns my ancestry. When too
young to have the smallest interest in the
matter, I heard my two half-brothers and
William Fairfax conversing on the subject
of the origin of my family. The brothers
were not very clear as to our descent, but
were of opinion that we came of the Washingtons
of Sulgrave, originally of Lancashire.
In 1791 the Garter king-at-arms, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Isaac Heard, wrote to me, sending a pedigree
of my family; but I had to confess it
was a subject to which I had given very little
attention; in fact, except as to our later
history, I could only say that we came from
Lancashire, Yorkshire, or some still more
northerly county.</p>

<p>Most of the early colonists of all classes
were too busy in fighting Indians and raising
the means of living to concern themselves
with the relatives left in England.
This indifference was not uncommon among
us, and was in those early days to be expected.
It explains why we and other descendants
of settlers knew, and indeed
cared, too little about our ancestors.</p>

<p>I do not know what exactly was the station
of the father of the brothers who first
came over—John, my ancestor, and Lawrence,
his brother. It is of more moment
to me to know that my forefathers in this
country have been gentlemen, and have in
many positions of trust, both in civil employ
and in the military line, served the colonies
and, later, their country with faithfulness
and honour.</p>

<p>As concerns the question of ancestry and
a man’s judging of himself by that alone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
I am much of Colonel Tilghman’s opinion,
who once said to me, speaking of Mr. B——,
that when a man had to look back upon his
ancestors to make himself sure he was a gentleman,
he was but a poor sort of man, which
I conceive to be true.</p>

<p>My great-grandfather, John Washington,
the first emigrant of our name, was the son
of Lawrence and Amphilis, his wife. He
went first to the Barbados, but, not being
pleased, came later to Virginia; that is, in
1657.</p>

<p>It is certain that my great-grandfather
in some respects possessed qualities which
resembled those which I myself possess.
He was a man of great personal strength,
inclined to war, very resolute, and of a masterful
and very violent temper. He was
accused in 1675 of too severe treatment of
the Indians in the frontier wars against the
Susquehannocks, for which he was reprimanded
by Sir William Berkeley, but, it is
said, unjustly. He was a man had in esteem
and most respectable, and held a seat
in the Assembly in 1670. He was also of a
nature greatly moved by injustice, for on his
voyage to Virginia a poor woman on board
the ship was hanged for a witch, and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
made great efforts, on being come ashore, to
have the master and crew punished. I find
in myself the same anger at injustice.</p>

<p>It is proper to add that there was current
in the colony a story that, on account of
his rigour with the Indians, he was called
by them Conocatorius, which, Englished,
means a Destroyer of Villages. The Half-King,
an Indian chief so called, hearing my
name when first we met, addressed me by
this title. There must have been among
these tribes a remembrance or tradition as
to the name, for certainly I never deserved
it, and that after so long a time it should
have been remembered appears to me
strange.</p>

<p>My great-grandfather’s brother Lawrence
was engaged for a time in the mercantile
way, and at one time signed himself
as of Luton, County Bradford, merchant.
He made some voyages to Virginia and
home again before he settled in the colony,
and may have acquired land in England,
for, as I shall state later, he devised real
estate in the home country.</p>

<p>As I speak of the home country, I am
reminded that even after the War of Independency
the habit of speaking of England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
as home prevailed with many, so strong
was the attachment to the mother country;
and, indeed, nothing but the folly of Great
Britain could have broken the bonds which
united us.</p>

<p>My great-grandfather, John Washington,
brought with him a wife from England.
Her maiden name I do not know. She and
her two children died within a few years
of his landing. The brothers mention in
their wills property in England, but where
or exactly what it was they do not say. It
would seem, therefore, that it was not poverty
which drove my ancestor to emigrate.
That this property was not mere money,
the proceeds of tobacco, appears to be
shown by the will of my great-grandfather’s
brother Lawrence, who devised to Mary, his
daughter, his whole estate in England, real
as well as personal.</p>

<p>My great-grandfather married secondly
the widow of Walter Broadhurst, daughter
of Nathaniel Pope of Appomattocks, gentleman.
My grandfather Lawrence was the
first born of this marriage. My great-grandfather
died in 1677. He was of that
importance as to have named for him the
parish in which he resided. The brothers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
were not the only ones of the name who
came to Virginia. There was also a cousin,
Martha Washington. She emigrated to Virginia
and married Nicholas Hayward of
Westmoreland. How it was that, being a
spinster, she came over alone, I am not informed.
She left her property to her cousins
John and Lawrence, and a gold twenty-shilling
piece to each, and to their sons
each a feather bed and furniture, and to
their heirs forever—which does appear to
me long for a bed to last.</p>

<p>There were also others, but if related I
have not felt concerned to inquire. They
spelled the name Vysington in certain
deeds, which I have heard was the ancient
manner of spelling it. Of them I know
nothing further. My great-grandfather left
a legacy to the rector of the lower church of
Washington parish, and ordered that a funeral
sermon be preached, which appears to
me, as Lord Fairfax said, to be a certain
way to secure being well spoken of, at least
once, after death. He also provided in his
will for a tablet of the Ten Commandments,
and also the king’s arms, to be set up in the
church of his parish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>He may have been led to come to Virginia
by the fact that it had become for
men loyal to the crown and to the Church
of England a refuge such as the Puritans
sought in Massachusetts. We have ever
since been connected with that Church, nor
have I found reason to depart from it. At
times I have been a vestryman, but this was
in those days also a civil office, having judicial
duties, such as charge of the schools and
of the poor of the parish.</p>

<p>My connection with the Church of my
fathers has varied in interest from time to
time, for, although I have at times partaken
of the sacrament and even fasted, I have
not always felt so inclined, although I have
with reasonable punctuality attended upon
the services. I have had all my life a disinclination
to converse on this subject, and
confess, as Dr. Franklin once remarked to
me, that “silence is sometimes wisdom as
concerns a man’s creed.”</p>

<p>In considering so much of my family history
as is known to me, I perceive that men
married at an early age and remained no
long time widowers. Also I observe that
many children died young, as was like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
enough to happen on plantations remote
from physicians, and indeed these were few
in number and not as good as in the northern
colonies.</p>

<p>I know less of my grandfather Lawrence
than of his father. He did not increase the
importance of the family, neither was he
inclined to public business. He was, as I
have understood, a quiet, thrifty man, and
no seeker of adventure by land or water.
He married Mildred Warner, by whom he
had children, and died leaving a competent
estate, but none to be compared with the
great lands accumulated by the Byrds or
Carters.</p>

<p>I conceive him to have been a person of
moderate opinions concerning the Church
of England, and as one who may have considered
the dissenting sects as ill used. This
I gather from a book given to me three
years ago by a gentleman of Philadelphia,
of the Society of Friends, who would have
had me to believe that my grandfather was
of that sect. This book is the life of one
John Fothergill, a Quaker preacher, who
says that in 1720 he “held a meeting at Mattocks,
at Justice Washington’s, a friendly
man, where the Love of God opened my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
heart toward the people, much to my comfort
and their satisfaction.” I do not suppose
it to have meant more than that, as the
church could not be used by a dissenter, Justice
Washington willingly gave the good
man the use of his own house.</p>

<p class="cap">My father, Augustine, was born in 1694,
on the plantation known as Wakefield,
granted, in 1667, to his grandfather,
and lying between Bridges’ and Pope’s
creeks, in Westmoreland, on the north neck
between the Potomac and the Rappahannock.
My father, in his will, says: “Forasmuch
as my several children in this my
will mentioned, being by several Ventures,
cannot inherit from one another,” etc.</p>

<p>What he speaks of as his “Ventures”
were his two marriages. A venture does appear
to me to be an appropriate name for
the uncertain state of matrimony. The first
“venture” was Jane Butler, who lies buried
at Wakefield. Of her four children two
survived—that is, my half-brothers Lawrence
and Augustine, whom we called Austin.
I was the first child of my father’s
second “venture,” and my mother was
Mary Ball. I was born at Wakefield,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
February 11 [O. S.], 1732, about ten in the
morning. I was baptized in the Pope’s
Creek church, and had two godfathers and
one godmother, Mildred Gregory. Mr.
Beverly Whiting and Mr. Christopher
Brooks were my godfathers. I do not recall
ever seeing Mr. Whiting, although his
son, of the same name, I met in after years.
Of Mr. Brooks I know nothing, nor do I
know which one of the two gave me the
silver cups which it was then the custom for
the godfather to give to the godson. I still
have them. I was told by a silversmith in
Philadelphia that the cups are of Irish
make, and of about 1720. There were six of
these mugs, in order to be used for punch
when the child grew up.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> This estate was bought by my father from his
brother John.</p>

</div>

<p>The Balls were respectable, and came
out first as merchants. My maternal grandmother
we know to have been Mary Johnson,
of English birth, but of her family
nothing more. At a later time the older
planter families, both with us and in the
West Indies, paid more attention to their
ancestry, sometimes, it is to be feared, with
pretensions which had no just foundation.</p>

<p>Many assumed arms to which they were
not entitled, or, like Mr. J——n, commissioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
an agent in London to purchase
some heraldic device, having Mr. Sterne’s
word for it that “a coat of arms may be
purchased as cheap as any other coat.”</p>

<p>I have had some reason to believe that
our friends did not regard my mother’s
family, being in the mercantile line, as on
the same social level as our own. But, in
fact, we ourselves were not until a later
day considered as of the highest class of
Virginia gentry. Why this was I do not
fully know. It is certain, however, that
nowhere were aristocratic pretensions and
the distinctions of social rank more marked
than in Virginia. For a long time families
like the Lees, Byrds, Carys, Masons, etc.,
regarded themselves as superior to other
planter families, of as good or better
blood.</p>

<p>The lines of social rank among us I judge
to have been made early to depend on extent
of landed property, so that the owners of
these vast estates were like great nabobs,
and by having seats and control in the governor’s
council and the House of Burgesses
obtained large influence. They were at
pains to defend their pretensions by a law
of primogeniture, which made entails so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
strict that they could not be broken, as in
England, by agreement of father and son,
but required to break them, in each case, an
act of the Assembly. Families like our own
were regarded rather as minor gentry, and
were, for a time, owing in a measure to their
having but moderate estates, looked down
upon by certain of the great proprietors
of enormous plantations and numberless
slaves.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the reason, or
the reasons, I was more than once made to
feel the fact that I was not looked upon
as an equal by certain of these gentlemen,
and this at an age when men are sensitive
to such considerations.</p>

<p>My father, Augustine, has been described
as a good planter and a man of energy. I
apprehend that he was of a serious tendency,
for Lawrence, my brother, once gave me to
understand that most of the few books at
Wakefield were religious; but whether this
was so or not I do not know. Like some of
the rest of us, my father had a high and
quick temper, which, as he used to say, he
had to keep muzzled. I remember being terrified
at seeing him in a storm of anger
because the clergyman who was to have baptized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
my sister Mildred was too much in
liquor to perform the ceremony.</p>

<p>About the year 1724 he became interested
in the mining of iron ore with the
Principio Company, in which the venturers
were chiefly English. A furnace was opened
on his estate in Stafford County. It was
confiscated in 1780 as rebel property. He
had a contract for hauling the ore from the
mines, and later commanded a ship for the
taking of iron to England and the fetching
back of convict labourers. On this account,
I apprehend, he was known as Captain
Washington. He was, I have understood, a
man of enterprising nature and better informed
than most planters of his time.</p>

<p>He was educated at Appleby in England,
near Whitehaven. I have often regretted
that I never had his opportunities, or those
of my brothers, in the way of education.
The fact of my being a younger son and my
father’s death, and also my mother’s overfondness,
may have stood in the way, and on
this and other occasions interfered with my
own plans or with those of others for me.</p>

<p>I did not take after my mother in appearance,
and I had the large frame and
strength of my father. In other respects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
also I was somewhat like him in my mind
and character.</p>

<p>When in later years I returned to visit
Wakefield I used to fancy I remembered
it. This I could not have done, as I was
only three years old when, because of the
unhealthfulness of the place, my father
moved away. The house was burned down
on Christmas eve, 1779. It was of wood,
with brick foundations, and had eight bedrooms.
There was an underground dairy,
a great garden with fig-trees and other fruit,
and along the shores were wild flowering
grapes and laurel and honeysuckle and
sweetbrier roses, very fragrant in the spring
season. Here in the middle of a great field
lie my ancestors and some of the children of
my father’s first marriage.</p>

<p>In the year 1735 we moved, as I have
said, fifty miles higher up the Potomac to
the estate then known as Epsewasson or
Hunting Creek. This was given, with other
land, by the colony to my great-grandfather
and Colonel Spencer for importing an hundred
labourers, and was bought by my father
in 1726 from my aunt Mildred Gregory,
later my godmother. It came afterwards to
be called Mount Vernon. It was at that time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
in Prince William County, which my father
represented in the House of Burgesses, as
my brother did later. There we remained
until 1739.</p>

<p>In this year our house took fire, as was
supposed, by the act of one of our slaves, but
never surely ascertained. We were then
obliged to remove, and this time settled in
Stafford, formerly St. George, on the east
bank of the Rappahannock, opposite to
Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>This residence was a two-story house on
a rise of ground, with a fertile meadow
sloping gently to the river. It was built of
wood and painted red. There, as people
well-to-do, we lived until my father’s death,
when the division of his estate did somewhat
lessen the easiness of our lives; and
of these latter years I can recall some more
or less distinct remembrances, for here my
education began.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">While I was a child, my father, as I
have said, made many voyages to
England and fetched back with him convicts,
and perhaps also indentured servants.
Often in those days some of the unfortunate
people thus sent to the colonies were under
sentence for political offences, but many, of
course, for crimes. One of these, a convict
I was told, was my first schoolmaster. We
called him Hobby, which was, I believe,
a nickname; but he was named Grove, and
was sexton of the Falmouth church, two
miles away. Of what our sexton schoolmaster
had been convicted I never heard,
but of this I am assured, that my father
would not have used as a schoolmaster a
common thief. I used to ride the two miles
to the “field-school,” as they called it, in
front of a slave named Peter, and later was
allowed a pony, to my mother’s alarm when
he would tumble me off, as happened now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and then. Hobby was a short man, with one
eye, and too good-humoured or too timid to
be a good teacher, even of the a-b-c’s and
the little else we learned.</p>

<p>My father was kind to this man, and perhaps
knew his history. He would even have
allowed him the use of the rod, with the aid
of which I might have profited more largely,
for I am of his opinion that children should
be strictly brought up. Hobby, being of a
humourous turn, seems to me, as I remember
him, to have resembled the grave-digger in
the play of “Hamlet.” He sometimes
amused and at other times terrified us by
tales of London or of his recent life as a sexton.
He believed many of the negro superstitions—as
that if a snake’s head was cut
off the tail would live until it thundered—and
was much afraid of having what he
called black magic put upon him by the
negroes.</p>

<p>I did not learn much from Hobby and
preferred to be out of doors. My father
considered, I believe, that, as I was a
younger son and must in some way support
myself, I should be well trained in both
mind and body, and had he lived the chance
of the former might have been bettered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
The latter was often made difficult by my
mother, who was unhappy when I was subject
to the risks to which all lads of spirit
are exposed. I remember that, when later
my father was teaching me to leap my pony,
the pony refused over and over, and this
being near to the house, my mother ran out,
and at last had a kind of hysterick turn. My
father sat still on a big stallion and took no
notice of her entreaties. At last I got the
pony over, and he fell with me. I jumped
up and was in the saddle in a moment. My
father said that was ill ridden, I must try it
again; and upon this my mother ran back
to the house, crying out I would be murdered.
But my father was this manner of
man; he hated defeat, while my mother was
ever desirous of keeping me out of danger,
because it made her uncomfortable; and this
was strange, for I have never been able to
see that she was greatly pleased when I was
successful, or was much moved by what the
great Master allowed me to attain in later
years.</p>

<p>My elder brothers, Lawrence and Augustine,
were both at different times sent to
England for education at Appleby School,
near Whitehaven, when I was a child. Lawrence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
had the family liking for enterprises
and martial employment. I was eight years
old, and he of age, when Lawrence served
with Admiral Vernon and General Wentworth
in the disastrous attack on Cartagena.
I remember as a boy the interest this
expedition caused in our neighbourhood. It
was said that Harry Beverley and other
Virginians captured by the Spaniards had
been made to work as slaves, and this
stirred up much feeling among us. The ex-Governor
Spottiswood, although an aged
man, would have gone as a major-general,
but died suddenly at Temple Farm, near
Yorktown, where forty-two years later Lord
Cornwallis met me to sign the capitulations.</p>

<p>Lawrence was away two years. The letters
wrote by him to my father were full
of interest, and, as I remember, were the
means of arousing in me, who was but a
little lad, the liking for warfare, of which
we all had a share.</p>

<p>I can remember how, as we sat about the
hearth at evening, my father read aloud
to us these letters, and explained to me the
military terms used, and why, for want of
foresight, the gallantry of soldiers and sailors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
served only to give opportunity for loss
of life. This was especially in connection
with the last letter we received, after the dismal
failure of the attack on Cartagena. He
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Honoured and dear Father</span>: What with dissensions
between the General Wentworth and
Admiral Vernon, who was, as we think, not to
blame, we have come away, leaving the Spaniards
to crow, and our Colonel Gooch ill at Jamaica.
When I am to have another dose of glory I pray
to have better doctors.</p>

<p>We were to storm Fort <i>Lazaro</i>—which must
mean Lazarus—at night. But we were too long
getting there, or the guides treacherous, and the
ladders too short and no sufficient breach. This
<i>Lazarus</i> fort was too much alive, but we were actually
on the rampart when Colonel Grant was
killed, and we were driven back in sad confusion,
and half of us, a good thousand, killed or wounded
for want of forethought. I came off with no more
hurt than to be so spent that I had no breath
to curse the folly for which so many brave men
died. The climate was worse than the dons, and
we took ship with our tails between our legs and
some two thousand shaking with agues and racked
with fever.</p>
</div>

<p>When I heard this I jumped up and said
I wished I could have been there, upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
which my father laughed and said I was
better off where I was, and my mother that
I had better go to bed.</p>

<p>I was at that age when lads of spirit are
apt to ask questions, and concerning these
my father was always patient, and encouraged
a reasonable curiosity; but, on the
other hand, my mother disliked this habit of
curiosity, and when my father talked of Indian
wars and of my brother’s fine conduct
at Cartagena she was sure to say I should
never go to war. My father would reply
that it was sometimes the business and also
the duty of a gentleman, and then there was
no greater pleasure than to hear over and
over how Sir Henry Washington, said to be
of our family, defended Worcester in the
civil war in England.</p>

<p>In those days all the world was at war,
and with us there was always the dread of
Indian outbreaks. It was no wonder that
I and other little fellows at Hobby’s school
played at soldiering. A lad named William
Bustle, a fat, sturdy boy, was commander
of the Indians, and in the woods we imitated
the red men and the frontier farmers,
and passed from tree to tree throwing
stones, or, in winter, snowballs, with mock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
scalping and much pulling of hair, which
was worn long. This was interfered with
one winter because Bustle hit me in the
eye with a snowball in which was a stone,
a thing not considered fair. My mother
wished Bustle punished. My father said I
must take care of my own quarrels, and
this I did, for, being then ten years old,
and very strong, as soon as I went back
to school I gave Bustle a good beating.
In fact, I was of unusual strength, and because
of my violence of temper felt no
hurt, and would not listen when Bustle
called, “Enough.” My mother’s uncertain
discipline and her too affectionate weakness
did me great harm. For if my father
punished me on account of disobedience or
outbursts of temper, my mother was sure
to interfere, or to coddle and pity me, a
thing I greatly disliked. I never learned
much self-control until a later day, which,
in its place, I shall call to mind.</p>

<p>My sister Betty, who afterwards married
Fielding Lewis, was, next to my half-brother
Lawrence and my brother Jack, most dear
to me. Samuel had some of the weaknesses
of my mother, and Charles, in later days,
some worse ones of his own. In after life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Samuel was often in debt, and was married
five times, being extravagant in this as in
all other ways. Mildred was sadly affected
from birth and died young. It was unfortunate
for me that while I was a child my
half-brothers were sent from home and put
in charge of the plantations of Wakefield
and of Mount Vernon, which had been rebuilt
and given the name of the admiral
whom Lawrence much admired.</p>

<p class="cap">In 1742 Lawrence came from Cartagena,
and meant to continue in the service,
but, after our sudden way, he fell in love
with Anne, the daughter of William Fairfax
of Belvoir, our neighbour, the cousin and
agent of my lord of that name, and this,
luckily for my own character, ended his
desire for a military life. I too well recall
the event which delayed his marriage. I
was at this time, April 17, 1743, being
eleven years old, on a visit to my cousins
at Choptank, some thirty miles away. We
were very merry at supper, when Peter, who
was supposed to look after me, arrived with
the news of my father’s sudden illness. It
was the first of my too many experiences of
the ravage time brings to all men. I heard
the news with a kind of awe, but without
realizing how serious in many ways was
this summons. I rode home behind Peter,
and found my mother in a state of distraction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
She led me to the bedside of my
father, crying out, “He is dying.” The
children were around him, and he was
groaning in great pain; but he kissed us
in turn, and said to me, “Be good to your
mother.” I may say that throughout her
life I have kept the promise I made him
as I knelt, crying, at his bedside. He died
that night, and I lost my best friend.</p>

<p>My mother for a month talked of him
incessantly, and after that very little, except
to say, “If your father were alive I
should be more considered.” I do not
know why I, too, was averse to speaking
of him, and yet I loved him above all people.
But concerning such matters children
are puzzled, and unable to express themselves,
nor have I ever been other than shy
in saying what I feel in the way of affection,
whereas on paper I do not suffer this
shyness, nor feel the reserve which occasioned
Colonel Trumbull to say to me
once that I was often unjustly regarded
as cold because of my difficulty of being
outspoken concerning my regard for those
dear to me. I am little better of it to-day.</p>

<p>My father had much land and little
money. As was usual in Virginia, he left to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
his elder sons the larger share. To Lawrence
he gave his interest in the iron-works,
with Mount Vernon and two thousand five
hundred acres, also the resident slaves and
the mill, and, in case of his failure to leave
a child lawfully begotten or such child
dying under age, this property was “to
go to and remain” to me. To Augustine
he left Wakefield; to me his farm on the
Rappahannock and one moiety of his land
on Deep Run, with ten negro slaves. Samuel,
John, and Charles were also given land
and slaves, and Betty four hundred pounds.</p>

<p>My mother was to have my estate for
her use until I was of age, and with whatever
else was left her, and her own sixteen
hundred acres, might have sufficed with
economy; but that virtue she found difficult
to practise, and was never a prudent
or managing woman. She soon felt her
children to be a heavy burden upon an
estate which was none too large, and complained,
as was common for her to do all
her life, that she was poor, and this even
when I was assured that she was comfortably
cared for. I never knew a more affectionate
mother. She was said to have
been foolishly fond of her children, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
was more than once brought to feel that
her love of us did interfere with good judgment.
Certainly whatever were her opinions,—and
we did not often agree,—these
differences never lessened my love for her,
as differences often do. As she grew old
her peculiarities were more and more notable.
With very many good qualities, she
was hard to satisfy, and this did not cease
until the end of her life, for she could not
be restrained from borrowing money and
accepting gifts from those who were not
her relations. Indeed, I once had to write
her that while I had a shilling left she
should never want, but that I must not be
viewed as a delinquent, or be considered
by the world as unjust and an undutiful
son. But so was she made, and even her
doctor, Thornton, wrote to me in her last
illness, in which his cousin, Dr. Rush, was
also consulted, that he “had every day a
small battle with her.”</p>

<p class="cap">My father died in April, 1743, and Lawrence
was married to Miss Fairfax
in June of that year. It was fortunate for
me that my brother’s wife, Anne Fairfax,
soon shared the constant affection felt for
me by her husband Lawrence.</p>

<p>Austin, as we usually called Augustine,
also embarked into the matrimonial state
as the husband of Anne Aylett of Westmoreland,
who brought him a large property.</p>

<p>The next three years of my young life
were important. I learned very soon from
my mother that, when of age, I would have
a moderate estate and insufficient. It is a
happy thing that children have no power
to realize what money means to their elders,
else I might have been set against Lawrence
and thought my father unjust. As
I did not understand my mother’s complaints
of poverty, they had no effect upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
me. After my father’s death, and in the absence
of my elder brothers, the house and
farm soon showed the want of a man’s
care, and we lads enjoyed at this time almost
unlimited freedom. My older brothers
saw it, and felt that I, at least, might
suffer, being of an age and nature to need
discipline and to be guided. In fact, I delighted
to skip away from my man Peter,
and find indulgence in roasting ears of Indian
corn in the forbidden cabins of the
field-slaves, or in coon-hunts at night, when
all the house was asleep. When my pranks
were discovered my mother was sometimes
too severe in her punishments, or else only
laughed.</p>

<p>Nothing was assured or certain in the
house, now that the hand of wise and strong
government was gone.</p>

<p>We were taught the catechism as a preparation
for Sundays, and my mother read
the Bishop of Exeter’s sermons or Matthew
Hale’s “Commentaries, Moral and Divine.”
I still have this book. It belonged originally
to my father’s first wife, Jane Butler,
and below her name my mother wrote her
own, “Mary Ball.” At this time she was
much given to Puritanical views, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
were beginning to be felt in Virginia, owing
largely to the want of better clergymen in
the Established Church. She would have
the servants up late on Saturday to cook,
that there might be no labour on Sunday.
In consequence, the blacks fell asleep in
church. My mother would then get up in
mid-service, and go where they sat, and poke
them awake with her fan.</p>

<p>At this period my great personal strength
and endurance were constant temptations
to forbidden enterprises on land or water,
and it was at this time of my life that I
discovered a certain pleasure in danger. I
find it difficult, not having the philosophical
turn of mind, to describe what I mean;
but of this I became aware as time went on,
that, in battle or other risks, I was suddenly
the master of larger competence of mind
and body than I possessed at other times.</p>

<p>When, on one occasion, the learned Dr.
Franklin desired to be excused if he asked
whether in battle I had ever felt fear, I had
to confess that in contemplating danger
I was like most men, but that immediate
peril had upon me the influence which liquor
has upon some, making them feel able for
anything. He said yes, but as to the influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
of drink, that was a mere delusion;
whereas he understood, and here he begged
to apologize, that, in great danger in battle
and when the ranks were breaking, I had
seemed to possess powers of decision and
swift judgment beyond those I could ordinarily
command. I said it was true, that
danger seemed to lift me in mind and body
above my common level, and that it was the
satisfaction this gave which made danger
agreeable; not, be it said, the peril, but the
results.</p>

<p>I apprehend him to have been correct,
for in battle I have often felt this, as at
Monmouth, at Princeton, and elsewhere.
In general, my mind acts slowly, and I have
been often painfully aware of it when in
council with General Hamilton, Mr. Jefferson,
or General Knox. General Wayne was
fortunate in this quickening of the mind in
danger. He once said to Colonel Humphreys
of my staff that he disliked danger,
but liked its effects upon himself when it
came.</p>

<p>Certainly I had my share of risks at the
time I now speak of. No one controlled
my actions, and old Peter, in whom my
father had greatly trusted, now allowed me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
in general, to do as pleased me. The river
and the forests afforded game, but the riding
of half-broken horses was what most I
liked. My joy in the horse and his ways
was the mere satisfaction in conquest and in
the training of a strong brute; but it made
me a good horseman, and helped, though I
knew it not then, to prepare me for the years
when I was to be so much in the saddle.</p>

<p>We had at this time a slave named Sampson,
who possessed great control over animals.
He was old in our service, and very
black. He was said to be a Mandingo negro,
and to do very well if kindly treated. The
blacks of this tribe incline to take their own
lives if what they feel to be disgrace falls
upon them, and this man, for whom my father
had a great liking, never had been
whipped. He had charge, under the overseer,
of the stables, the brood-mares, and the
training of horses for saddle or harness.</p>

<p>I was at this time more about the stables
than was allowed under my father’s rule,
and did, in fact, much as I liked out of
school hours. It so happened that once,
on a Saturday, there being no school, I
was very early at the stables, and, as there
was no one to hinder, made the groom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
saddle a hunter we had. On this I made
my appearance at a meet for fox-hunting,
four miles from home, to the great amusement
of the gentry. They asked me if I
could stay on, and if the horse knew he had
any one on his back. However, the big sorrel
carried me well, and knew his business
better than I did. I saw two foxes killed,
and this was my first hunt; but as I rode
home my horse went lame, and, to save him,
I dismounted and led him. Towards noon,
when we were come to the farm stable, I
found the overseer, with a whip in his hand,
swearing at Sampson, and making as if
about to beat him. I ran up behind them
and snatched away the whip. The overseer
turned and, seeing me, said he meant to
punish Sampson for letting me take a
horse which was sold to go to Williamsburg.
When he knew the horse was lame, he was
still more angry; but I declared I was to
blame, and no one else, and said he should
first whip me. He said no more, except that
my mother would say what was to be done.
I think he made no report of me, and certainly
my mother said nothing. When the
overseer had walked away, the old servant
thanked me, and said no one had ever struck
him, and that it would be his death. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
seemed strange to me, a boy, for the slaves
were whipped like children, and thought as
little of it. Sampson said to me that I was
like my father, that when I was angry I became
red and then pale, and that I must
never get angry with a horse.</p>

<p>After this interference Sampson took
great pains with me and taught me many
useful things about horses. Although I
became a good horseman, I never had his
strange gift of managing dogs or other
creatures. Indeed, he was the only black
man I ever saw who could handle bees, for
these industrious little insects have a great
enmity to negroes.</p>

<p>All this happened in October, 1743, and
was the means of making a useful change
in my life and ways. At about this time
my two brothers came together to visit us,
in order to satisfy my mother’s complaints
that she was never so poor and, since my
father died, was not ever considered. It
seems that at this time she was, as she remained
until death, a dissatisfied woman,
although never without sufficient income.
She was, I fear, born discontented, and
could not help it; for happiness depends
more on the internal frame of a person’s
mind than on the externals in this world.</p>

<p class="cap">While matters concerning the estate
were being discussed, Lawrence soon
discovered so much of my too great freedom
that he and my half-brother Augustine
insisted that I go to live for a time with the
latter, near to whose abode was a good
school. My mother wept and protested, but
at last agreed, with impatience, that I might
go if I wished to do so. Of this Lawrence
felt secure, for he had promised me a horse
for myself and clothes to come from London,
especially a red coat. I have always
had a fancy for being well clothed; and as I
was less well dressed than other gentlemen’s
sons, the idea of a scarlet coat, and the
promise of spurs when I had learned to ride
better, settled my mind. I liked very well
the great liberty I had, and to part with this
and my playfellows I was not inclined; but
I felt, as a boy does, that I was being made
of importance, which pleases mankind at all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
times of life. I may say, also, that I was become
more grave than most of my years,
and was curious to see Williamsburg, where
lived the king’s governor, and something
beyond our plantation.</p>

<p>I remember that George Fairfax insisted
once that no action ever grew out of only
one motive, and, as I see, there were several
made me willing to leave my home.
Thus when Lawrence talked to me of his
wars, and of his friends the Fairfaxes, and
of how I must also soon visit him at Mount
Vernon, I readily agreed to his wishes. It
was hard to part with Betty, who looked
like me until I had the smallpox, and with
my dear brother Jack; but I was eager, as
the day came, to see the outside world, and
I rode away very content, on a gray mare
with one black fore foot, beside Augustine,
and my man Peter after us.</p>

<p>It was a long ride across the neck and
down to Pope’s Creek on the Potomac, and
I was a tired lad when we rode at evening
up to the door of the house of Wakefield,
where I was born eleven years before.</p>

<p>Here began a new life for me. Anne
Aylett, Mrs. Augustine Washington, was a
kind woman, very orderly in her ways, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
handsome. After two days Peter was sent
home, and I was allowed to ride alone to
a Mr. Williams’s school at Oak Grove, four
miles away.</p>

<p>I took very easily to arithmetic, and,
later, to mathematic studies. I remember
with what pleasure and pride I accompanied
Mr. Williams when he went to survey some
meadows on Bridges’ Creek. To discover
that what could be learned at school might
be turned to use in setting out the bounds of
land, gave me the utmost satisfaction. I
have always had this predilection for such
knowledge as can be put to practical uses,
and was never weary of tramping after my
teacher, which much surprised my sister-in-law.
I took less readily to geography and
history. Some effort was made (but this
was later) to instruct me in the rudiments
of Latin, but it was not kept up, and a
phrase or two I found wrote later in a copybook
is all that remains to me of that
tongue.</p>

<p>I much regret that I never learned to
spell very well or to write English with
elegance. As the years went by, I improved
as to both defects, through incessant care
on my part and copying my letters over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
and over. Great skill in the use of language
I have never possessed, but I have always
been able to make my meaning so plain in
what I wrote that no one could fail to understand
what I desired to make known.</p>

<p>I have always been willing to confess
my lack of early education, but notwithstanding
have been better able to present my
reasons on paper than by word of mouth.
I am aware, as I have said, that, except in
the chase or in battle, my mind moves
slowly, but I am further satisfied that under
peaceful circumstances my final capacity to
judge and act is quite as good as that of men
who, like General Hamilton, were my superiours
in power to express themselves. I
may add that I learned early to write a clear
and very legible hand. As to spelling, my
mother’s was the worst I ever saw, and I
believe King George was no better at it than
I, his namesake. This just now reminds me
that I may have been named after his grandfather,
King George II, for George was not
a family name, and, as we were very loyal
people, it may have been so.</p>

<p>It was usual in those days to give to
children names long in use in a family.
John, Augustine, and Lawrence, for males,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
were repeated among us, and Mildred and
Harriott; but I never heard of a George
Washington before me, nor of any George
in our descent, except my grandmother’s
grandfather, the Hon. George Reade of
his Majesty’s council in 1657. General
Hamilton at one time interested himself in
this matter, but I could make no satisfactory
answer. I suppose my mother knew.
I never thought to ask her. General Hamilton
made merry over the idea of how much
it would have gratified his present Majesty
to have known of his grandfather being thus
honoured.</p>

<p>Indeed, it pleased Mr. Duane, when maligning
me, to call me Georgius Rex, but of
this I apprehend that I have said enough.
It is of no importance.</p>

<p>Outside of my school, the life at Wakefield
was well suited to a lad of spirit.
There were thirty horses in the stables, and
some of them well bred and had won races
at Williamsburg.</p>

<p>The waters of Pope’s Creek, where the
Potomac tides rush in at flood and out at
ebb through a narrow outlet of the creek,
were full of crabs, oysters, clams, and fish.
One of the slaves, named Appleby after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
August’s school, was engaged in the supply
of fish, which the many negroes and the
family needed. I think there were, at the
least, seventy blacks. Being permitted to
go on the water with Appleby, I found
much satisfaction in sailing and rowing
and the search for shell-fish. My brother
August once surprised me by saying that
some day the bottom of the Bay of Chesapeake
would be a richer mine, on account
of the oysters, than my brother Lawrence’s
iron-mines, by which we all set great store.
This may some day come to pass. The
quantities of shad took in April and May
were enough to feed an army, and what we
did not eat went to feed the land.</p>

<p>In the autumn I was sometimes allowed
to sit with August in a wattled blind, behind
brush, while at dawning of day he shot
the ducks, geese, and swans which flew over
the little islands of Pope’s Creek in great
flocks.</p>

<p>I prospered in this hardy life and grew
strong and able to endure, nor was it less
good for me in other ways; for, although
I cared very little for August’s fiddling, nor
to hear Anne sing, nor for the books, of
which there was a fair supply, I admired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
August so much that I began, as some lads
will do, to imitate his ways of doing things.
And this was of use to me, for August was
very courteous and mild-spoken to people
of all classes, and much beloved by his
slaves, to whom he was a gentle and considerate
master.</p>

<p>The country along the Potomac was well
settled with families of gentry, and visits
were made by rowboats, so that I found very
soon boy companions, although Belvoir,
where the Fairfaxes lived, and Mount Vernon,
rebuilt in 1742, being remote, were less
frequently visited.</p>

<p>The church at Oak Grove was the better
attended, and few persons were presented
or admonished for non-attendance, because
on Sunday, as many drove long distances,
provisions were brought, and in the
oak grove near by, between services, there
was a kind of picnic, very pleasant to the
younger people.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Soon after going to live for a season at
Wakefield with Augustine, I began to
take myself more seriously than is common
in boys of my age. I believe I have all my
life been regarded as grave and reserved,
although, in fact, a part of this was due to
a certain shyness, which I never entirely
overcame, and of which I have already
written. My new schoolmaster, Mr. Williams,
gave me a book which I still have,
and which here, and later at Mount Vernon,
was of use to me. It was called the
“Youth’s Companion.” It contained receipts,
directions for conduct and manners,
how to write letters, and, what most pleased
me, methods of surveying land by Gunter’s
rule, and all manner of problems in arithmetic
and mathematics, as well as methods
of writing deeds and conveyances. Young
as I was, it suited well the practical side of
my nature; for how to do things, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
doing of them so as to reach practical results,
have never ceased to please me.</p>

<p>My mother’s natural desire for my presence
wore out the patience of Augustine,
and I was at last, after some months (but
I do not remember exactly how long), sent
back to her and to a school kept by the
Rev. James Marye, a gentleman of Huguenot
descent, at Fredericksburg, and from
whom I might have learned French. My
father had been desirous, I know not why,
that I should learn that language; but this
I never did, to my regret. I should have
been saved some calumny, as I shall mention,
and later also inconvenience, when I
had to deal with French officers during the
great war. I had then to make use of Mr.
Duponceau and of Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh
Wynne of my staff, but had been better
served by G. W. had I known the French
tongue.</p>

<p>I was at this time about fourteen, and
was, as I said, a rather grave lad. I was
industrious as to what I liked, but fond of
horses and the chase, and was big of my
years, masterful, and of more than common
bodily strength.</p>

<p>I was not more unfortunate than most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
other young Virginians in regard to education.
Governor Spottiswood, as I have
heard, found no members of the majority
in the House who could spell correctly
or write so as to state clearly their
grievances. There were persons, like the
late Colonel Byrd, who were exceptions, but
these were usually such as had been abroad.
Patrick Henry, long after this time, observed
to my sister that, even if we Virginians
had little education, Mother Wit was
better than Mother Country, for the gentlemen
who came back brought home more
vices than virtues. In fact, this may have
been my father’s opinion; for, although he
sent Lawrence and Augustine to the Appleby
School in England, he would not allow
of any long residence in London, where, he
said, “men’s manners are finished, but so,
too, are their virtues.”</p>

<p>For a few months in the next year I spent
about half of the time with my mother.
While there I studied, as before, at the
school kept by the Rev. Mr. Marye. The
rest of the time was spent in the company
of Lawrence and his lady at Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>Lawrence was a tall man, narrow-chested,
and less vigorous than Augustine. He was,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
however, fond of the chase and fox-hunting,
and had books in larger number than was
usual among planters. I remember him as
very pleasing in his ways, and possessed of
a certain reserve and gravity of demeanour,
which, as my sister Betty Lewis remarked,
made his rare expressions of affection more
valuable.</p>

<p>He seemed to me the finest gentleman
I ever knew, and I took to imitating him as
my model, as I had done Augustine, which
was at times matter for mirth to Anne, his
wife. No doubt it seemed ridiculous, but it
was, I do believe, of use to me.</p>

<p>As I write, I recall with unceasing gratitude
the great debt I owe to my brother’s
care of me at this period of my life. I was
encouraged when I was at Mount Vernon—as
I was then for a time away from school—to
keep up my studies, and I remember
that I fell again with satisfaction upon the
manual I just now spoke of. It is still in my
possession, and my wife’s children once
made themselves uncommon merry over the
ill-made pictures I drew on the blank pages;
but it was of use to me as no other book ever
was.</p>

<p>I was early made to understand that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
must do something to support myself. The
few acres on the river Rappahannock were
not to be mine until I became of age, and
until then were my mother’s; indeed, I never
took them from her. My brother disapproved
of the easy, loose life of the younger
sons of planters, and, of course, trade was
not to be considered, nor to work as a clerk;
and yet, without care, accuracy, and such
business capacity as is needed by merchants,
no man can hope to be successful, either as
a planter or even in warfare.</p>

<p>Ever since I had been at Mr. Williams’s
school, I had a liking for the surveying of
land, and had later been allowed to further
inform myself by attending upon Mr. Genn,
the official surveyor of Westmoreland, a
man very honest and most accurate. Indeed,
I had so well learned this business that
I became, to my great joy, of use to Lawrence
and some of his neighbours, especially
to William Fairfax, who had at first much
doubt as to how far my skill might be
trusted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile various occupations for me
were considered and discussed by my elders.
The sea was less favoured in Virginia than
at the North; but many captains of merchant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
ships were in those days, like my father,
of the better class, and my brothers,
who saw in me no great promise, believed
that if I went to sea as a sailor I might be
helped in time to a ship, and have my share
in the prosperous London trade.</p>

<p>Like many boys, I inclined to this life.
I remind myself of it here because it has
been said that I was intended at this time
to serve the king as a midshipman, which
was never the case. Meanwhile,—for this
was an affair long talked about,—my mother’s
brother, Joseph Ball, wrote to her
from London, May 19, 1746, that the sea
was a dog’s life, and, unless a lad had great
influence, was a poor affair, and the navy
no better. Upon this my mother wrote,
offering various trifling objections, and at
last hurried to Mount Vernon, and so prevailed
by her tears that my small chest was
brought back to land from a ship in the
river.</p>

<p><a href="#i_frontis">My brother</a> Lawrence <a href="#i_frontis">comforted me in
my disappointment</a>, saying there were many
roads in life, and that only one had been
barred. I remember that I burst into tears,
when once I was alone, and rushed off to
the stables and got a horse, and rode away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
at a great pace. This has always done me
good, and, somehow, settled my mind; for
I have never felt, as I believe a Latin writer
said, that care sits behind a horseman. I
jolted mine off, but for days would not have
any one talk to me of the matter. Even as
a lad, I had unwillingness to recur to a
thing when once it was concluded, and that
is so to this day.</p>

<p class="cap">The summer passed away in sport and
in visits to William Fairfax, who lived
below us on the river. Here I saw much
good society, among others the Masons,
Carys, and Lees, and formed an attachment
to William Fairfax, the master of Belvoir,
and his son George, which was never broken,
although we came long after to differ in
regard to our political views. But of this,
and of his cousin, Lord Fairfax, more hereafter.
In the fall of this year I returned
to my mother, or rather, as before, I went
to board across the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg,
in the house of a widow of the
name of Stevenson, which she pronounced
Stinson. She had, by her two marriages, six
sons, two of them Crawfords and four Stevensons.
They were all well-grown fellows,
and of great strength and bigness.</p>

<p>I am reminded, as I set down in a random
way what interests me, that, as I expected,
this act of attention brings to mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
some things which I seemed to have altogether
forgotten. Among them is this, that,
just before returning to my school, I went
with Lawrence to pay my respects to Lord
Fairfax, who was come for a visit to his
cousin at Belvoir. We found the family,
however, in sudden distress at the news,
just arrived, of the death in battle of
Thomas, the second son, who was killed in
the Indies, in an engagement on board his
Majesty’s ship <i>Harwich</i>. We made, on this
account, but a short stay. I remember that,
as we rode away, Lawrence said to me: “A
great preacher called Jeremy Taylor wrote
a sermon about death, and gave a long list
of the many ways of dying. Which way,
George, would you wish to die?” I said I
did not wish to die at all.</p>

<p>Lawrence said: “But you will die some
day. What way would you choose?” I said
I thought to die in battle would be best,
and I said this because I remembered with
horror watching how my father died and
how greatly he suffered.</p>

<p>Lawrence said: “The good preacher did
not speak of that way to die.” Now, as I
write, being in years, it seems that not in
that way shall I die, nor does it matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>After this I went back to my mother, or
rather to the town of Fredericksburg. I
liked it the more because Colonel Harry
Willis lived there. He married first my
aunt Mildred, and second my cousin Mildred,
so that I had about me many cousins,
with also Warners and Thorntons of my
kindred.</p>

<p>I was here fortunate in my teacher, of
whom I have spoken before. This gentleman,
the Rev. James Marye, was very different
in his ways from some of the clergy
put upon us by the Bishop of London, hard-drinking,
ill-mannered men. Mr. Marye
was got for St. George’s parish, on a petition
of the vestry to Governor Gooch. He
was rector thirty years, and was succeeded
by his son.</p>

<p>On Sunday, as was quite common in Virginia,
the girls and boys were heard the
catechism by the rector, and those who did
well were rewarded from time to time—the
girls with pincushions and the boys with
trap-balls.</p>

<p>The sons of the widow in whose house
I lodged during the week were, as I have
said, rough, big fellows who damaged a
great deal the pride I had in my strength,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
because among them, for the first time as
concerned lads of near my years, I met my
match in wrestling and jumping, and what
we called the Indian hug. Almost all of
them served under me in the war, and one,
William Crawford, rose to be a colonel and
perished miserably, being burned at Sandusky
in the war with the Indians, after
their cruel way.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Marye concerned himself
more than the ordinary schoolmaster with
the manners of his scholars. I may have
been inclined beyond most lads to value his
rules of courtesy and decent behaviour, for
I kept the book in which I was made to copy
the one hundred and eighteen precepts he
taught us. I conceive them to have been of
service to me and to others. I find the mice
have gnawed and eaten a part of these rules.
When, of late, I showed them to my sister
Betty, she said she hoped eating of them
would make the mice polite, for she was
dreadfully afraid of those little vermin.</p>

<p>In this manner my next two years passed
by. During this time I became still further
attracted by the exactness and interest of
the surveying of land, which I carried on
without present thought of gain. I used to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
ride into the woods, and, leaving my horse
tied, make use of Peter as a chain-bearer.
Sometimes my cousins went with me, especially
Lewis Willis, my schoolmate. But
they soon grew tired and went to bird-nesting,
or digging up of woodchucks, or to
making the “praying-mantis” bugs fight
one another. I never had much inclination
towards games which had no distinct or lasting
result. At any time I preferred for my
play to fish or shoot, when allowed, or to
measure lands and plot them.</p>

<p>Any work demanding strict method is
good for a lad, and I found in surveys an
education of value and one suited to my
tastes, which never very much inclined to
discover happiness in constant intercourse
with my fellow-men, nor in much reading
of books.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">At the age of fifteen, in the fall of 1747,
I went once more, for a time, to reside
with Lawrence at Mount Vernon, where it
was to be finally determined what I should
do for a livelihood. As I look back on this
period of my life, I perceive that it was the
occasion of many changes. I saw much
more of George William Fairfax and
George Mason, ever since my friends, and
was often with George’s father, the master
of Belvoir, only four miles from Mount
Vernon.</p>

<p>There came often, for long visits, William’s
cousin, Lord Fairfax, over whose
great estates in the valley William was the
agent. I learned later that when first his
lordship saw me he pronounced me to be
a too sober little prig—and this, no doubt,
I was; but after a time, when he came to
overcome my shyness, he began to show
such interest in me as flattered my pride<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
and pleased my brother Lawrence. At this
period Lord Fairfax was a tall man and
gaunt, very ruddy and near-sighted.</p>

<p>It was natural that as a lad I should be
pleased by the notice this gentleman, the
only nobleman I had ever seen, began to
take of me. My fondness for surveying he
took more seriously than did my own people,
and told me once it was a noble business,
because it had to be truthful, and because
it kept a man away from men and, especially,
from women. I did not then understand
what he meant, and did not think it
proper to inquire.</p>

<p>I owed to this gentleman opportunities
which led on to others, and to no one else
have I been more indebted. I trust and
believe that I let go no chance in after life
to serve this admirable family.</p>

<p>True friendship is a plant of slow growth,
and must undergo and withstand the shocks
of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation.
In fact, much disaster has befallen
these friends, from whom politics and
distance have separated me without weakening
my gratitude or affection.</p>

<p>It has often happened to me to learn that
I am thought to be a cold man, but this I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
believe to be untrue; for though I am, as
concerns social intercourse and freedom of
speech, a man reserved by nature, I discover
in myself a great freedom to express myself
affectionately on paper—nor do I conceive
that I am unlike others in feeling the loss of
the many friends whom distance or death
has separated from me. But I will not repine;
I have had my day.</p>

<p>As my brother was aware of the advantage
it might be to me to secure the good
will of the Fairfaxes, I was encouraged to
visit Belvoir often, and thus was given me
the chance to be, when he chose, in the
company of his lordship, who was at this
time a frequent guest at Belvoir with his
cousins, and now and then at Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>The company of these gentlemen was
of much value to me, and in all ways useful.
William Fairfax was a man of honour
and great probity; also very courteous.
He had seen service in both Indies, and
had divers adventures in clearing the pirates
out of New Providence, all of which
I was delighted to hear of, and he to relate.
He had lived as a collector of customs in
the New England colonies, having taken
a wife at Salem, and had a greater respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
for them than was common in Virginia. Indeed,
in those days our planters despised
the men of the North as mere traders and
Puritans, while they, in their turn, considered
us godless, drunken, fox-hunting
squires, out of which prejudices arose, during
the great war, many jealousies and
troubles, of which, God knows, there were
enough without these.</p>

<p>At this time I was old enough to take
an interest in what my elders said of the
politics of the colonies. I was more and
more surprised to hear how lightly they
regarded the governor. I listened also to
their complaints of the too frequent interference
in affairs of which we knew much,
and the advisers of the crown in England
very little. They complained that enterprise
was crippled on sea and land, and
considered smuggling a just way to escape
some of the grievous duties laid between
the colonies. They felt it unjust that we
must use none but British ships on the
ocean, and be cut off from the natural channels
of commerce, etc. I listened eagerly
and wondered, as a boy would, why these
great gentlemen, who seemed to me so powerful,
should submit to such wrongs. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
spoke also with anger of the way in which
the colonies were being loaded with thieves
and women of the worst class, sent out as
convicts. Of the political convicts they
spoke with pity, as indeed they might, for
some of these were gentlemen of good
families, and in later times, being freed,
prospered in honourable conditions of life.</p>

<p>There were some singular matters combined
with the condition of indentured servitude.
Especially was I one day astonished
to learn that at one time, but earlier
than this, if the white master of an indentured
man was fined and could not pay,
the debt might be satisfied by the whipping
of one of these bad or unfortunate servants.</p>

<p>Both Fairfaxes spoke with more freedom
of the king than did my brothers. Perhaps
they inherited some of the liberty of
thought which made the famous earl of
their name a rebel to the crown in the time
of the Commonwealth; and yet, when, at
a later day, we had even greater cause to
rebel, they were, to my sorrow, loyal Tories.</p>

<p>I was not without younger friends, for to
Belvoir came the Carlyles, cousins of the
Fairfaxes from Alexandria, my own cousin
Lawrence, with my dear cousin Robin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Washington of Choptank, and many more,
such as the Carys, Mrs. Fairfax’s kindred,
the Masons, and my sister Betty, a great
favourite. But of all these people, the Lord
Fairfax most affected my life, and indirectly
prepared me for the career of a frontier
officer. At this time he was fifty-nine years
old. Although a heavy man, he was a fine
horseman; and as I never was tired of the
saddle, we were much engaged in the hunting
of wild foxes, or, lacking these, of foxes
bagged by the negroes and let loose for the
sport. He was a man who disliked women,
and avoided society, or was inclined to be
silent in company; but with me he was a
most lively companion, and would tell me of
Oxford, and of having written papers in
the “Spectator,” which I had then begun
to read. My sister Betty was inclined to
be merry over his lordship’s fancy to have
me ride and hunt with him, saying that as
I never talked except to answer questions,
and his lordship talked only once a week,
we were well matched. My brother Lawrence
considered her wanting in respect,
and that his lordship might be of much
service to me. I could talk when occasion
served, but I had been taught that it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
for my elders to choose whether I should
talk or not. There were times when his
lordship was pleased to encourage me in
the asking of questions, and at other times
liked to puzzle me with matters beyond
my years.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XI">XI</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">In this pleasant company of William
Fairfax and his wife, and my friend
George William, his son, I saw with profit
something of the ways and manners of persons
of consideration, and, being by nature
observant, profited accordingly. Indeed, the
Lord Fairfax more than once commended
the matter to my attention, saying that
good and fitting manners to men of all
classes would often obtain what could not
be otherwise as easily had. I do not now
recall the phrase he used, but, if I recollect,
it was out of a letter written to Sir
Philip Sidney by his father.</p>

<p>I find it curious to recall how at this
time I appeared to others, and, concerning
this, I have found a letter addressed by
Lord Fairfax to my mother. In one of
her sudden and often brief ambitions for
me, she desired to know of his lordship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
whether it would not be well for me, like
Mr. C—— and Colonel H——, to go to
Oxford. When riding with the old gentleman
the next day, he told me of her wish.
I was surprised, but even then I knew she
would, at the last minute, change her mind,
and I said as much, with due respect. For
a time he rode on in silence, and at last
said: “Young man, this is your country;
stay here. What do you want to do?” I
said boldly I should like to be a surveyor
and help in the settling and surveying of
his lordship’s lands in the valley. He said
I was young to contend among hostile squatters,
but he would talk with Lawrence of
it. I heard no more of Oxford, and this
is the answer he made my mother. It seems
to me as I read this letter, after the lapse
of forty-nine years, that what his lordship
wrote was very near to the truth;
nevertheless, it greatly displeased my
mother. But she was always displeased
with any one who did not agree with her,
which, indeed, was hard to do, as sister
Betty Lewis once said, because, whenever
for peace you were on her side, you
found that she had changed to the opposite
opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>He wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><i>Belvoir.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honoured Madam</span>: You are so good as to ask
what I think of a temporary residence for your
son George in England. It is a country for which
I myself have no inclination, and the gentlemen
you mention are certainly renowned gamblers and
rakes, which I should be sorry your son were exposed
to, even if his means easily admitted of a
residence in England. He is strong and hardy,
and as good a master of a horse as any could desire.
His education might have been bettered,
but what he has is accurate and inclines him to
much life out of doors. He is very grave for
one of his age, and reserved in his intercourse;
not a great talker at any time. His mind appears
to me to act slowly, but, on the whole, to reach
just conclusions, and he has an ardent wish to
see the right of questions—what my friend Mr.
Addison was pleased to call “the intellectual conscience.”
Method and exactness seem to be natural
to George. He is, I suspect, beginning to feel
the sap rising, being in the spring of life, and is
getting ready to be the prey of your sex, wherefore
may the Lord help him, and deliver him from
the nets those spiders, called women, will cast for
his ruin. I presume him to be truthful because
he is exact. I wish I could say that he governs
his temper. He is subject to attacks of anger on
provocation, and sometimes without just cause;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
but as he is a reasonable person, time will cure
him of this vice of nature, and in fact he is, in my
judgment, a man who will go to school all his
life and profit thereby.</p>

<p>I hope, madam, that you will find pleasure in
what I have written, and will rest assured that
I shall continue to interest myself in his fortunes.</p>

<p>Much honoured by your appeal to my judgment,
I am, my dear madam, your obedient humble
servant,</p>

<p class="right"><i>Fairfax.</i></p>

<p>To Mrs. Mary Washington.</p>
</div>

<p>My nephew Bushrod Washington, in arranging
my papers, placed all my Fairfax
letters in one packet, and thus it chances
that lying next to this one is a letter from
Bryan Fairfax, the brother of my older
friend, written in 1778 from New York. I
am pleased to find it here, and thus to be
reminded of the vast changes through which
time gives us opportunities. I had been
able to stop the Whigs in New York from
offensive attacks upon this gentleman, and
on this he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are times when favours conferred make
a greater impression than at others; for, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
I have received many, I hope I have not been unmindful
of them; yet that, at a time your popularity
was at the highest and mine at the lowest,
and when it is so common for men’s political resentments
to run up so high against those who
differ from them in opinion, you should act with
your wonted kindness toward me, has affected me
more than any favour I have received; and such
conduct could not be believed by some in New
York, it being above the run of common minds.</p>
</div>

<p>When Lord Fairfax died in his ninety-second
year, my old comrade, this Bryan
Fairfax, became the heir to his title, but I
believe never allowed himself the use of it,
and, becoming a clergyman of our church,
is still thus engaged.</p>

<p>The finding of these two letters moved
me more than common. Two matters are
alluded to in his lordship’s letter to my
mother which, otherwise, I might not have
reminded myself of, and yet one of them
had an important influence on my life.</p>

<p>I had been told, of a Sunday morning,
of a great flock of ducks, of the kind called
canvasback, and much esteemed. It was
against our habits to shoot on this day,
but towards evening, the temptation being
great, I went to the shore and was about to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
push off, when Peter, using the liberty of
an old family servant, said I would make
Mr. Fairfax and my brother, then like myself
at Belvoir, angry if I went. When he
held on to the prow to stay me, I suddenly
lost my temper and struck him with an oar
on the head. He fell down and lay in a sort
of a shake. I thought he was killed, and
had he been white I must surely have put an
end to him; but the blacks have thick skulls,
and presently he got up and staggered away,
his head bleeding. I was both sorry and
scared, for he would not wait when I called,
but walked off to the quarters of the slaves.</p>

<p>I stood still a minute, and then went to
the house and told Lawrence, and asked
him to have the man looked after. Lawrence,
being very angry, said: “This comes
of your hot temper. Once our father nearly
killed a man for a small matter, and that
cured him; I hope this may cure you.” I
said nothing, and went to see if the man
was badly hurt. Peter only laughed and
said: “Master George, you hit mighty
hard.” I liked the man, and, although no
one else spoke of the matter again, it had
more effect on me than the many good resolutions
I had written or made as to keeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
my temper. I have rarely lost it completely
since that time: once at Monmouth, once
after Edmund Randolph’s treachery, and
once when General Knox, then of my cabinet,
showed me a vile caricature of myself
being guillotined.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XII">XII</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Like other men, I have had my times of
being irritable, but open anger is with
me like to a tornado, and if I give way I
am as is a ship in a storm when no anchors
hold. General Hamilton, on one occasion,
observed to me that there were some talents
which it was good that men should
know you to be possessed of, because once
they were aware of this, you were not so
apt to be called upon to use them, and this
may be true of that rage of anger I now
speak of. But I cannot think it a thing of
value, nor of any real use; for if it follow
another’s actions, it can do no good, and
there are better ways of showing disapprobation.</p>

<p>The other matter to which his lordship
alludes is that I was, at this time, the victim
of one of those attachments to a lady
older than myself from which lads are apt
to suffer. It was not the last, for in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
composition of the human frame there is
a good deal of inflammable matter. My
fancy lasted for some months, but was
cured at last by hard work and life in the
saddle. It was full time that I got away
from the easy hospitality of Belvoir and
Mount Vernon. A masterful nature amid
slaves is not so well situated as among
scenes where he has to contend with those
who can resist. Since I became a man I
never approved of human slavery, and
surely the worst thing ever done to the colonies
was the act of England in forcing upon
us an endurance of the trade in slaves. The
evil results of this tyranny I do not propose
to discuss fully, but sure I am that the continuance
of this form of servitude will some
day give rise to troubles. I find myself,
however, inclined to believe that the habit
of mastery, also the aristocratic turn which
society acquired in Virginia, had a certain
value in our war with the mother country.
In Virginia the minor officers, such as captains,
were of a higher class than their privates,
and for this reason, and on account
of being from youth upward accustomed to
command obedience and exact discipline,
were in this respect well fitted for warfare.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
In New England, especially, under more
democratic circumstances, and also because
there were few slaves, the officers, such
as captains and lieutenants, were unused to
control men who, being of their own class,
acknowledged of late years no such differences
of position as in Virginia, and were
very insubordinate. I found in this state of
things a serious obstacle to discipline when
I first took command at Cambridge.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is worthy of remark
that no general officers of great distinction
were of Southern birth. All of those on
whom I learned to depend most largely were
born in the North, or had lived long in the
colonies north of Maryland. Of these were
the generals Knox, Morgan, Wayne, Hamilton,
Montgomery, Schuyler, Greene, and,
alas! Arnold; and generally these were men
who were not of the upper classes. This is
a matter which I once had occasion to mention
to Mr. Edmund Pendleton, who was of
opinion that, as the first open warfare was
at the North, and the first army there collected,
it was natural that the early opportunities
and high commissions should have
fallen to men of the North. I was unable to
deny this, but upon reflection it does not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
present to me a satisfactory explanation,
since the actual war lasted seven years and
afforded many chances to men of all sections.
I find myself naturally drawn into
these reflections by the events of my early
life, but such interruptions are of no moment,
because I am endeavouring, for my
own satisfaction and with no thought of
others, to consider rather how certain steps
in life prepared me for larger tasks, than
with a view to any connected narration.</p>

<p>There lived near Mount Vernon at this
time a man named Van Braam, a Dutchman,
who, having served under my brother
Lawrence at Cartagena, was used at times
as a clerk. He was a slight, wiry little man,
and dependent in those days on my brother’s
aid. He spoke French, but whether
well or ill I was too ignorant to know; yet,
because of his supposed knowledge, he came
later to be the innocent means of getting
himself and me into unpleasant difficulties.
Like Lawrence, he was an accomplished
swordsman; and I received from him lessons
in the small sword, and became myself
expert in this, as I have usually been in all
exercise involving strength and accuracy,
being more quick of body than of mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>This talent of the sword was an accomplishment
which I never had to use personally,
nor have I ever been so unfortunate
as to have needed it in the duel. Experience
has proved that chance is often as
much concerned in these encounters as
bravery, and always more than the justice
of the cause. I felt regret that my friend,
General Cadwalader, should have exposed
a valuable life to the pistol of a man like
General Conway, especially since the real
cause of the quarrel was, I am assured, language
used by the latter which my friend
knew I could not resent.</p>

<p>Indeed, in an affair like that of these two
generals, it would have been reasonable to
have decided by lot which was wrong; for a
farthing was tossed as to who should be
first to fire, and both were good shots.
Happily, my friend was fortunate, and the
other, who had considered his honour
wounded, was now in addition wounded in
his tongue—the organ which made all the
mischief.</p>

<p>This lamentable manner of settling disputes
was the occasion, while we lay at the
Valley Forge, of our losing valuable officers.
I have always discouraged it. Many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
of the duels in the war might have been
avoided by the help of judicious friends.
When Captain Paul Jones desired to call
out Mr. Arthur Lee, I dissuaded him from
asking my friends, the two C——s, to be
his advisers, on account of the too pugnacious
tendencies of these gentlemen of
Welsh blood.</p>

<p class="cap">The question of whether I should become
a surveyor by profession was
much debated among us. My youth was
against it, but I was in strength and seriousness
older than my years. My mother opposed
it, as she did every change, being of
those who are defeated beforehand by obstacles.
Without any better plan of life to
offer, she insisted that it was not an occupation
for a gentleman. This was, in a
measure, true in Virginia. The bounds of
estates were often vague or contested, and
there was a strong prejudice against the
persons employed to settle these disputes,
or who were engaged in laying out new
plantations beyond the Alleghanies, and
who took daily wages, like mechanics.</p>

<p>The planters settled on the tide-water
coast or on the rich river lands were long
since uneasy because they feared the settlements
made inland might interfere with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
their control of the trade in tobacco, in the
culture of which they were exhausting the
soil. At one time the king endeavoured to
prevent settlements beyond the mountains,
under the pretence that they would be too
little under government. It was believed,
however, that the jealousy of the long-settled
planters was the real means of bringing
about this decree, which no one obeyed.
The more enterprising families, who were
disposed to engage in the acquisition of
such lands, were looked upon with suspicion.
Nor were their active agents regarded
with favour. Indeed, long afterwards
I was subject to reproach because
of having been engaged in the occupation
of a surveyor of lands. The prejudice entertained
by the gentry of Virginia was not
without foundation in the character of
many of those who were thus employed, for
they were not all of a decent class, and were
subject to be influenced by bribes, so that
out of their misconduct arose many tedious
disputes as to boundaries.</p>

<p>Although among my elders there was
much discussion as to my choice of a means
of livelihood, I cannot remember that it in
any way affected my own resolutions or,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
in the end, those of my brothers. It was
finally concluded that I was to serve under
Mr. Genn, my former instructor in surveying,
and was to be accompanied by Mr.
George William Fairfax on a visit to the
estate of Lord Fairfax.</p>

<p>The prospect of being able to earn my
own living, and of a life in the wilderness,
filled me with pleasure, and I set about preparing
flints, powder, and shot for the new
fowling-piece his lordship was so kind as to
give me. I had the foresight, also, to take
some lessons in the shoeing of horses, and,
after a visit to my mother, was fully prepared
for my journey.</p>

<p>I hold it most fortunate that my own
inclinations and the good sense of my brothers
set me to work at a time of life when
temptations are most dangerous because of
their novelty. Many of the young men I
knew became brutal from contact with
slaves, and spent their lives, like some of
their elders, in fighting cocks and dogs and
in running quarter-races. A few men were
brought up to professions; but as estates
were entailed on elder sons, or they, at least,
received the larger portions, and there was
no army or navy, the younger sons were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
generally without occupation and apt to
fall into evil ways. I little knew, when I
rode away, how fortunate was my choice.</p>

<p>We set out on March 11, 1747, George
William Fairfax and I, with two servants
and a led horse, loaded with a pack and
such baggage as could not be carried in
saddle-bags. I was at this time ill, not having
recovered from an attack of the ague;
but the action of the horse and the feeling
of adventure helped me, so that in a day
or two I left off taking of Jesuits’ bark, and
was none the worse.</p>

<p>I have now before me the diary I kept
as a lad of near sixteen years. It was not
so well kept as it was later, but already in
it I discover with interest that it turns to
practical matters, like the value of the land
and what could be produced on it.</p>

<p>As we were soon joined by my old master
in surveying, James Genn, I learned a
great deal more of his useful art, and usually
earned a doubloon a day, but sometimes
six pistoles. Although the idea of
daily wages was unpleasant to Virginians
of my class, I remember that it made me
feel independent, and set a sort of value
upon me which reasonably fed my esteem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
of myself, which was, I do believe, never
too great.</p>

<p>Our journey was without risks, except
the rattlesnakes, and the many smaller vermin
which inhabited the blankets in the
cabins of the squatters.</p>

<p>I remember with pleasure the evening
when I first saw the great fertile valley
after we came through Ashby’s Gap in the
Blue Ridge. The snows were still melting,
and on this account the streams were high
and the roads the worst that could ever be
seen, even in Virginia. The greatness of
the trees I remember, and my surprise that
the Indians should have so much good invention
in their names, as when they called
the river of the valley the Shen-an-do-ah—that
is, the Daughter of the Stars; but why
so named I never knew.</p>

<p>In this great vale were the best of Lord
Fairfax’s lands. Near to where this stream
joins the Potomac were many clearings, of
which we had to make surveys and insist on
his lordship’s ownership. Here were no
hardships, and much pleasure in the pursuit
of game, especially wild turkeys. I learned
to cook, and how to make a bivouac comfortable,
and many things which are part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
of the education of the woods. Only four
nights did I sleep in a bed, and then had
more small company than I liked to entertain.</p>

<p>I copy here as it was wrote by me, a
lad of sixteen, what we saw on a Wednesday.
It might have been better spelled.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At evening we were agreeably surprised by
ye sight of thirty odd Indians coming from war
with only one scalp. We gave them some liquor,
which, elevating their spirits, put them in ye humour
of dancing. They seat themselves around
a great fire, and one leaps up as if out of a sleep,
and runs and jumps about ye ring in a most
comicle manner; afterward others. Then begins
there musicians to play and to beat a pot half
full of water, with a deer-skin tied tight over it,
and a gourd with some shott in it to rattle, and
piece of a horse tail tied to it to make it look fine.</p>
</div>

<p>The Dutch, then of late come in from
Pennsylvania, I found an uncouth people,
who, having squatted, as we say, on lands
not their own, hoped to acquire cheap titles.
They were merry and full of antic tricks.
I talked with some by an interpreter and
heard them say they cared not who were the
masters, French or English, if only they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
were let to farm their lands. This amazed
me, who was brought up to despise the
French as frog-eating folk, and, indeed, this
indifference of the Dutch became a matter
of concern when we had a war with the
French.</p>

<p>After one night in a Dutch cabin I liked
better a bearskin and the open air, for it
was not to my taste to lie down on straw—very
populous—or on a skin with a man,
wife, and squalling babies, like dogs and
cats, and to cast lots who should be nearest
the fire.</p>

<p>I did not like these people, and the Indians
interested me more. Genn understood
their tongue well enough to talk with
them, and the way they had of sign-language
pleased Lord Fairfax, because, he
said, you could not talk too much in signs
or easily abuse your neighbour; but I found
they had a sign for cutting a man’s throat,
and it seemed to me that was quite enough,
and worse than abuse. Mr. Genn warned
me that one of their great jokes was, when
shaking hands with white men, to squeeze
so as to give pain. Being warned, I gave
the chief who was called Big Bear such
a grip that, in his surprise, he cried out, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
thus much amused the other warriors. This
incident is not in my diary, and I find it
remarkable that now, after so many years,
it should come to mind, when even some
more serious affairs are quite forgot.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Early in April, having completed our
work, I crossed the mountains afoot to
the Great Cacapehon, and, passing over the
Blue Ridge, on April 12 found myself again
at Mount Vernon. But before that I first
rode on to Belvoir, that I might be prompt
to answer his lordship’s questions. All he
would talk about was how to get horse and
man over rivers, and of a way I learned of
an Indian to wade across a strong swift
stream safely, even breast-high, by carrying
a heavy stone to keep me on my feet.
He advised me to learn the sign-language
of the savages.</p>

<p>He was soon to set out for the valley,
where he meant to lay out the manor of
Greenway Court and there reside. He desired
me to come and help to survey his
great domain.</p>

<p>There must be some natural taste in
man for the life in the woods, and, for my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
part, I longed ever to return to them, of
which, sooner or later, I had many opportunities.
Nor did the free life make me
less, but rather more, practical, and I
learned to observe the trees, and how the
land lay, and the meadows, whether liable
to flood or not, all of which enabled me
not only to serve my employers well, but
was of use to me when I became able to
purchase land myself.</p>

<p>About this time the influence of Lord
Fairfax and my brothers obtained for me
the place of surveyor of the county of Culpeper.
I saw, a few years ago, in the records
of Culpeper Court House, under date
of July 20, 1749, that George Washington,
gentleman, produced a commission from
the president and masters of William and
Mary College appointing him to be a surveyor
of the county, whereupon he took the
oath to his Majesty’s person and government,
and subscribed the abjuration oath,
the test, etc.</p>

<p>I recall now the pleasure this formal appointment
gave me. Although I was then
but seventeen years old, I was much trusted
and was soon busily employed, because of
my exactness, and because it was known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
that I could not be bribed; and thus for
over two years I pursued this occupation.
His lordship had long since this time left
his cousin’s house of Belvoir and gone to
live in the valley, in his steward’s house,
which now he bettered and enlarged for his
own use, meaning soon to build a great
mansion-house, which he never did.</p>

<p>His home was a long, low stone dwelling,
with a sloped roof, and many coops where
swallows came, and bird-cotes under the
eaves, and around it on all sides a wide
porch, with, in every direction, the great
forest of gum and hickory and oaks, and
the tulip-trees. I found the roads much improved
on my first visit, and many outbuildings
for slaves and others, with kennels
for the hounds his lordship loved to
follow. My own room was ever after kept
for me. It had a wide dormer-window, and
next to it a room with more books than I
had ever seen before, except at Westover,
Colonel Byrd’s great mansion.</p>

<p>I never passed the time more agreeably.
When not absent laying out land, we
hunted and shot game, especially wild turkeys,
which abounded; and when the weather
served us ill I read the history of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
England, and tried to please his lordship
by reading Shakspere and other books of
verse. But although I had by hard labor
managed to lay out and plot verses to certain
young women, I never found much
pleasure in the use of the imagination, nor
in what others made of it. It seemed to
me tedious and without practical value, nor
did it amuse me except when it was in a
play.</p>

<p>For days at a time I sometimes saw
nothing of this kind but eccentric nobleman.
A woman in England was said to
have wounded his life, and it was rare that
we had any female guests at Greenway
Court, except Anne Cary, the sister of
George William Fairfax’s wife. I found
it not good for me to be in her company,
for in some way she brought to my mind
a boy love, which I had resolved no more to
entertain, but which I found it difficult to
master.</p>

<p>Miss Cary stayed no long time, and others
came and went, but for the most part I
had his lordship to myself. There were
days when he was absent in the woods with
a servant, or alone. At others he would
remain all day shut up in a small log house,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
not over fifteen feet square, where he slept,
and, as he said, very ill. It was his custom,
however, to join me at supper, and
then to remain smoking, which I never
learned, and taking his punch. He was
either full of talk or so silent that we would
not exchange a word while he sat staring
into the fire. Sometimes, when tired, I fell
asleep, and, on waking, found him gone to
bed. When disposed for conversation, he
was apt to be bitter about his native land,
and once said that the best part of it had
come away.</p>

<p>My brother Lawrence and he were the
only persons of our own class I ever knew
in those days who, to my surprise, foresaw
serious trouble from the selfish policy of
the crown and the greed of English merchants,
who desired to keep us shut out of
the natural way of sea trade. I should
have been most ungrateful, which I never
was, had I not felt my obligations to Lord
Fairfax. His great wealth and high position
kept even my mother satisfied that
what pleased my patron could never be
complained of, and so, for a season, I was
let to go my own way.</p>

<p>He led me to feel sure that, soon or late,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
we must be at war with both France and
the Indians, or else submit to be shut out
of the fertile lands to the westward. He
was almost the only Englishman of high
rank whom we saw in Virginia. There were
governors with their secretaries, and officers
of the army, but, except my lord, all of
them regarded the gentlemen of the colonies
as inferior persons. This feeling was,
I apprehend, due to the fact that we looked
to England for everything, and were in
many ways kept as dependent as children.
He once said to me that we were like slow
bullocks that did not know their power to
resist. This was all strange to a young
Virginian in those days. I have lived to
see its wisdom, and now, as I think of it,
am reminded that Mr. Hamilton once wrote
to me, “a colony was always a colony, and
never could be a country until it had altogether
to stand on its own legs.”</p>

<p>This was spoken of Canada, which unwisely
refused to make common cause with
us, and will now be for us at least a troublesome,
if not a dangerous neighbour.</p>

<p>But to see her in the hands of France
was not, as the matter presented itself, to
be desired, for which reason I did not at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
a later time encourage Marquis Lafayette
in his design upon Canada, knowing that
if we succeeded in the war, and with French
troops were able to take Canada, France
would claim it as her share of the spoils,
and thus hem us in from Louisiana to the
Great Lakes. Indeed, this was very early
a constant fear throughout all the colonies,
and especially in New England, where the
notion of being shut in by a popish nation
added to their uneasiness.</p>

<p>When considering this matter, I recall
the effect of the capitulations of 1759, for
at that time, in order to quiet the French
after England had taken Canada, and to
get the Canadians to accept willingly English
rule, vast and unwise privileges were
granted to the Church of Rome. Still later
the Quebec Act of 1774 decreed that Quebec
should be held to extend over all the country
west of the Ohio and up to the lakes,
and thus that the privileges enjoyed by the
Romish Church should prevail over all this
great dominion.</p>

<p>While the Stamp Act and the laws restrictive
of trade did variously annoy the
separate colonies, the Quebec Act produced
a still more general dissatisfaction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XV">XV</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">While at Greenway Court I had
other teachers besides his lordship,
for many Indians, frontier traders, and
trappers came to claim food and shelter,
which were never denied them. Often the
woods were lighted up by their fires, and I
found it of use, and interesting, to hear
what was said and to learn something of the
uncertain ways of the savages.</p>

<p>I heard how the Delawares, Shawnees,
and Iroquois had wandered from the north
and taken to the lands about the Ohio, and
how the French protected them and claimed
all the country up to the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>To these camps came the rude, lawless
traders from Pennsylvania, who had stories
to tell of the Indians and of the French
beyond the Ohio. These men foresaw a
war on the frontier when scarce any others
did, and, by their accounts of the fertility
of the wide savannas beyond the Ohio, filled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
me with desire to explore this rich wilderness.
I learned that already the French
had warned the fur-traders to leave and
had driven away their hunters, and when
I mentioned this to Lawrence he said we
were not easy folk to drive, and, least of
all, Pennsylvania Quakers, and that there
would be trouble, which there was soon
enough. We were on the edge of a struggle
in which all the world was to share.
Meanwhile, time went on, and what Lord
Fairfax called the “frontier pot” was
boiling.</p>

<p>I was often back at home, sometimes
with my mother, or at Belvoir, or at Mount
Vernon, riding to hounds, surveying, and
making more than I needed in the way of
money, and enough to keep me in horseflesh
and to give me better clothes, for
which I have always had a fancy. Only in
the woods I liked best such dress as our
rangers wear, and good moccasins are the
best of foot-gear. But as to clothing, when
not in the woods, I found in myself a liking
for a plain genteel dress of the best, without
lace or embroidery. Fine clothes do
not make fine men, and the man must be
foolish who has a better opinion of himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
because his clothes are such as the truly
judicious and sensible do not advise.</p>

<p>Until I had money of my own I did not
venture much at cards; but now I played a
little, although I was never fond of it, and
lost more than I made. I was more inclined
to the game of billiards.</p>

<p>If at times I was in danger of leaning
towards the rough ways of the wilderness,
I had the advantage of seeing at Mount
Vernon, or at the homes of the Carters and
Lees, or among the Lewises of Warner
Hall, and elsewhere, the older gentry, who
were orderly and ceremonious, and who reminded
me anew of his lordship’s lesson as
to the value of good manners.</p>

<p>Sometimes on these great plantations I
was employed in surveys, but at others, as
at Shirley and the Corbins’, I was only a
guest. I was, I conceive, unlike the idle
young men of some of these houses, for I
was over-grave and cared less for card-playing
and hard drinking than suited
them.</p>

<p>I found myself at this time preferring
the society of women, who are always amiably
disposed to overlook the shyness of
men like myself, and with whom it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
to be agreeable without either punch
or tobacco; but racing of horses I always
liked, and dancing.</p>

<p>In those days cock-fighting was also to
my liking. I remember well, because it
was at Yorktown, a great main of cocks in
1752 between Gloucester and York for five
pistoles each battle, and one hundred the
odd. I was disappointed to leave before
it was decided. I saw there a greater cock-fight
in after days.</p>

<p>I recall now that my brother Lawrence
once wrote home from Appleby School that
each boy must pay to the master on Easter
Tuesday a penny to provide the school with
a cock-fight.</p>

<p>As to the hard drinking of rum and
bumbo, Madeira and sangaree, I never had
a head for it, or any liking, nor for the
English way of locking doors until the half
were under the table. These things were
not encouraged in the better houses, but
sometimes they were not to be avoided without
giving offence. The great war helped
to better these foolish customs, and now
they are more rare.</p>

<p>I remember, about this time, to have seen
such an occasion on a hot day in July at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
L—— Hall, where I was come to survey
a plot of meadow-land. I arrived about
7 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and I must needs go at once to sup
with a gay company of men, very fine in
London clothes. I would have excused myself
to be of the party, but no one would
listen to me, and, although dusty and tired,
I was pulled in whether I would or not. We
had a great supper, and Madeira wine, and
much rum punch, with wine-glasses which
had no stands or bottoms and must, therefore,
be kept in the hand until emptied.
When it became very warm, negroes were
sent for to fan us and to keep off the flies.
At last there was a dispute as to gamecocks,
and two were fetched in, very sleepy,
and set on the table to fight, which they
were little of a mind to, but were urged
until feathers and blood were all over the
table. When songs were sung, and most
very drunk, and the King toasted, I slipped
away, and would have got out the door, but
found it locked. Being unable to escape,
I was forced to return to the table. At last
a lighted candle having been set before each
guest, our host called on us to rise, and
when he cried out his toast, “The Ladies,
God bless them!” each gentleman, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
drained his glass, used it to extinguish the
candle-light set before him. It seemed to
me a strange custom. I took advantage of
the darkness to get out of an open window,
and was pursued by two or three, who fell
on the way, so that I got back to the house
and to bed, liking none of it. But now all
this is much amended, and there is more
moderation in drinking, but still too much
of this evil custom.</p>

<p>I am led here to remark that in the
War of Independency many officers who
were otherwise competent failed because of
drunkenness, and, indeed, at Germantown
this was one cause of our losing the battle.
When it became needful after St. Clair’s
defeat in 1791 to appoint general officers, I
furnished my cabinet with a statement of
the names and characters of such officers as,
having served under me, I knew should be
considered. As concerned most of them, I
found it well to state whether or not they
were addicted to spirits, so common was
this practice.</p>

<p>It seems very remarkable that so few
gentlemen should have foreseen what was
plain to the trappers and dealers in furs.
All of the Ohio country was claimed by both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
French and English. The Indians, although
cheated and made drunk, were still in possession
of the woods they considered to be
their own. Virginia claimed what Pennsylvania,
and even Connecticut, said was
theirs; Pennsylvania was reaping the only
harvest of the wilderness, of the value of
some fifty thousand pounds a year, the
trade in furs; last of all, in 1749, some enterprising
gentlemen in England and Virginia
planned the Ohio Company, meaning
to colonize even north of the Ohio.</p>

<p>When Mr. Thomas Lee, president of the
council, died, my brother Lawrence became
the head of the Ohio Company, and all of
this, as I now see, had much to do with the
next change in my life. I find it pleasant
again to dwell here on the good sense and
liberal spirit of my brother, who, had his
life been spared, would surely have been
chosen to do that which has fallen to me.
His character is well seen in his desire that
the Dutch from Pennsylvania, whom he invited
as settlers, being dissenters and having
come into the jurisdiction of Virginia,
should not be forced to pay parish rates
and support clergymen of the Church of
England, as all dissenters were obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
do. He urged that restraints of conscience
were cruel, and injurious to the country imposing
them, and he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I may quote as example England, Holland,
and Prussia, and, much more, Pennsylvania, which
has flourished under that delightful liberty, so as
to become the admiration of every man who considers
the short time it has been settled, whereas
Virginia has increased by slow degrees, although
much older.</p>
</div>

<p>There, on our borders, as Lord Fairfax
said, was much powder, and only one spark
needed to set it off. Meanwhile Mr. Gist
set out to survey the grant of the Ohio
Company, on the south side of the Ohio
River, all of which was greatly to concern
my life.</p>

<p>Virginia and Pennsylvania were, at that
time, much stirred up by the hostile threats
of France, and efforts began to be made
to prepare for hostilities on the frontier.
About this time, but the exact date I fail
to recall, my brother Lawrence abandoned
all concern in the military line of life, and
arranged that his place of major in the
militia should be given up to me, and that
I should also take his position as district
adjutant.</p>

<p class="cap">During the summer of 1751 I saw with
affectionate anxiety a great change in
the health of my brother Lawrence. I remember
no event of my life which caused
me more concern. Since our father’s death
he had been both father and friend. Had it
not been for him, I should not have known
Mr. Fairfax and his cousin, Lord Fairfax,
nor without their help could I have become
employed in a way which brought
about my service on the frontier and all
that came after. Thus, in the providence
of the Ruler of the events of this world,
one step leads on to another, and we are
always being educated for that which is to
come.</p>

<p>At last, in September, Lawrence, who
had been long ill of a phthisical complaint,
asked me to go with him to the Barbados.
Therefore, while Mr. Gist’s surveys on the
Ohio went on, and both English and French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
were making bids to secure the Indians, we
were on the sea. It is far from my purpose
to recall what, after a constant habit, is set
down in my diary. I lost in the Barbados
what good looks a clear skin gave me, because
of a mild attack of smallpox, such as
a third of the human race must expect, and
I remain slightly pitted to this day.</p>

<p>What most struck me in the islands was
the richness of the soil, and yet that nearly
all the planters were in debt, and estates
over-billed and alienated. They were all
spendthrifts, and I remind myself that I
resolved at that time never to be in the
grasp of the enemy called Debt. How persons
coming to estates of three hundred or
four hundred acres could want was to me
most wonderful.</p>

<p>Lawrence now declared for Bermuda, and
as he seemed better, I felt able to leave him
and return. To be torn by the demands
of public duty on the one hand and by the
call of affection on the other, I have many
times been subjected to. Lawrence insisted
that matters at home made urgent my return,
and, indeed, through life I have always
held that the public service comes
first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>I reached home in the ship <i>Industry</i>,
in February, 1752, having had enough of
the sea in a five weeks’ voyage, and very
stormy.</p>

<p>Lawrence was at times better and desired
to remain a year in Bermuda, and for
me to fetch his wife. But soon his mind
changed, and he wrote that he was resolved
to hurry home, as he said, to his grave.</p>

<p>In the little time that was between his
return and his passing away, I was much
in his company—nor have I ever since been
long without thought of him; for, although
I am not disposed to speak much of sorrow,
nor ever was, his great patience under suffering,
and how he would never complain,
but comfort his wife and me as if we were
those in pain, and not he, have often been
in my mind, and particularly of late, since
the increase of my own infirmities has reminded
me that the end of life cannot be
very remote.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that I must have seemed,
when younger, to be a dull, plodding lad;
but, as time went on, Lawrence came to
think more of me than did any, except Lord
Fairfax, and in this his last illness gave
me such evidence of his esteem as greatly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
strengthened my hope that I should justify
his belief in me.</p>

<p>General Hamilton once asked me whether
I did not think that at the approach
of death men seem sometimes to acquire
such clearness of mind as they might be
thought to obtain beyond the grave. I had
to reply that such considerations were remote
from my usual subjects of reflection;
but what he then said, although I had no
suitable reply, reminded me of certain
things Lawrence said to me, and of his
certainty that I should attain honourable
distinction. I thought him then more affectionate
than just, for I have never esteemed
myself very highly; but I know that I have
never ceased to do what I believed to be
my duty, and as to this my conscience is
clear.</p>

<p>My dear Lawrence died at Mount Vernon,
July 12, 1752, aged thirty-five years,
and thus I lost the man who had most befriended
me. As his infant daughter Sarah
inherited his estate, and I, although only
twenty years old, was one of his executors,
my time was fully occupied by this and by
the increase of public duties, which were
made heavy by the want of good officers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
and by the insubordination and drunkenness
of their men. Even then I saw what
must come of it all if we had a serious
war, for the militia could not by law be
used more than five miles outside of the
colony, and we should have to rely upon
volunteers for more extended service.</p>

<p>The little maid, my niece, at Mount Vernon,
did not live long after her father’s
death, and thus, as I have before stated, in
1754 the estate fell to me under the will
of my father. It was charged with a life-interest
in favour of my brother’s wife, who
soon married Mr. George Lee of Westmoreland.
I was obligated to pay her fifteen
thousand pounds of tobacco yearly;
and as the estate, because of Lawrence’s
illness, had fallen away, I was little the
better for the property until her death in
1761.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XVII">XVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On my brother’s return, although very
ill, he interested himself in my future,
and it was, no doubt, in part due to his influence
that, before his death, I was called to
Williamsburg, the seat of government, by
Governor Dinwiddie, who told me he was
advised to make me one of the adjutant-generals.
To my surprise, he seemed to
consider me competent, and, owing to my
brother, and probably also to the advice of
the Fairfaxes, I received this appointment
for the Northern Division, one of the four
now newly created, with the rank of major
and one hundred and fifty colonial pounds
a year.</p>

<p>To this day I do not fully understand
why I so easily secured this important appointment.
I was only nineteen and knew
nothing of war. As I consider the matter,
there were many more experienced men,
who, like Lawrence, had served at sea and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
on land. The other adjutants were older
than I. One of them said I would have a
bitter business, for the chief use of the
militia was to search negro cabins for arms
and to get drunk on training-days. Nevertheless,
as I knew well enough, there was
good stuff in the men of Virginia, and no
better could be found than the men of the
frontier, who were expert with the rifle and
were more than a match for the Indians.
As I learned from Lawrence, the candidates
for these places of adjutant were
either too old or were men of drunken
habits; and as to the wandering soldiers of
fortune who had had experience in war,
they were not gentlemen of our own class,
and this, I understood, was a question
which the governor and council considered
important.</p>

<p>When I went again to accept and thank
the governor for the appointment, he talked
to me at some length, and I learned that
he was more largely interested in the Ohio
Company than I had previously known,
and that one reason for my appointment
was my familiarity with the frontier country,
where I might have to serve. Without
further troubling myself as to why I, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
young man of nineteen, was thus chosen,
I set earnestly about my work. I found it
no easy task. I myself had much to learn,
and, by Lawrence’s advice, secured Mr.
Muse, formerly adjutant of a regiment, who
had served with my brother in the Spanish
war and now resided near us in Westmoreland.
This old soldier lent me books on
tactics, and taught me the manual of the
soldier, which was to prove of small value
on the frontier. Van Braam was also put
to use, as I wished now to learn the broadsword.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at intervals, I rode through
the counties of my district, and did my
best to ascertain how many men could be
counted on, and to stiffen the lax discipline
of the county militia.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that the governor,
Robert Dinwiddie, was more intent on making
money than on governing wisely.</p>

<p>Appointments to office, in my youth,
were very often obtained through family
and other influence, and were, like mine,
critically considered by many. Indeed, in
this year, not long before Lawrence died,
Mr. George Fairfax mentioned to me that,
being at Greenway Court, and Mr. Meade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
present, that gentleman inquired of him
how it chanced that a man so young as I
should have succeeded to obtain what older
men had failed to get. His lordship replied
for his cousin that he was mistaken as to
my age, for all the Washingtons were born
old, and he supposed that I was near about
thirty. Mr. Meade said that it was thought
my lord knew best who pulled the strings,
but to this, as George Fairfax said, laughing,
his lordship only smoked a reply.</p>

<p>This Mr. Meade was the father of Richard,
who served well as one of my aides in
the great war. David Meade, the second
son, was of those who believed that Colonel
Byrd should have been made commander-in-chief
by the Congress. It may
be that he was right, or would have been so
had Colonel Byrd been more decided in his
opinions. He had both ability and military
experience.</p>

<p>Mr. Meade was not alone in this opinion,
and was said to have himself entertained
the belief that, although I was, as he said,
a good business man and of irreproachable
morals, Colonel Byrd of Westover was my
superiour in some respects and in none my
inferiour, and of even greater experience in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
war. I have had at times to contradict the
statement that there was no opposition to
my appointment. I may add that I made
no effort to secure it, and I am sure that
no one doubted my capacity for the command
more than I myself; but of this I
have already said enough.</p>

<p>There were many in and out of the Congress
who preferred others. More than one
of the Virginia delegation has been said to
have been cool in the matter, and Mr. Edmund
Pendleton was clear and full against
my appointment. I have always taught
myself never to resent opposition founded
on honest beliefs or entertained by those
of unblemished character. Colonel Madison
once said to me that time is a great
peacemaker, but I have rarely needed it.
My breast never harboured a suspicion that
the opposition then made was due to personal
unfriendliness, for no man could have
had more reasonable doubt of my fitness
than I myself. Nor have I ever permitted
the remembrance to affect my actions, and
I have lived to have unequivocal proofs of
the esteem of some who most opposed me.</p>

<p class="cap">Like all Virginians, I was disturbed during
this time by the news of the insolence
of the French on the frontier, and
began to feel that my brother’s money, put
into the Ohio Company, was in peril, for
we were like to be soon cooped up by a line
of forts, and our trade in peltries was already
almost at an end, and about to pass
into the hands of the French. We learned
with pleasure that the royal governors were
ordered to insist on the retirement of these
overbusy French, who claimed all the land
up to the Alleghanies, but I did not dream
that I was soon to take part in the matter.</p>

<p>About that time, or before, there had
been much effort to secure the Six Nations
of Indians as allies. One of their chiefs,
Tanacharisson, known as the Half-King, because
of holding a subsidiary rule among
the Indians, advised a fort to be built by us
near to the Forks of the Ohio, on the east<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
bank, and Gist, the trader, set out on this
errand. A Captain Trent was charged to
carry our King’s message to the French outposts;
but having arrived at Logstown, one
hundred and fifty miles from his destination,
and hearing of the defeat of our allies,
the Miamis, by the French, he lost heart
and came back to report. The Ohio Company
at this time complained to the governor
of the attacks on their traders, and
this gentleman, being concerned both for
his own pocket and for his Majesty’s property,
resolved to send some one of more
spirit to bear the King’s message ordering
the French to retire and to cease to molest
our fur traders about the Ohio.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that Governor Robert
Dinwiddie, who was now eager to defend
his interests in the Ohio Company, had lost
the prudent counsel of its late head, my
brother Lawrence. He would have made
a better envoy than I, for at the age of
twenty-one a man is too young to influence
the Indians, on account of a certain reverence
they have for age in council. I was
ignorant of what was intended when I received
orders to repair to Williamsburg.
To my surprise, and I may say to my pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
I learned that I was to go to Logstown.
I was there to meet our allies, the
Indians, and secure from them an escort
and guides, and so push on and find the
French commander. I was to deliver to
him my summons, and wait an answer during
one week, and then to return. I was
also to keep my eyes open as to all matters
of military concern.</p>

<p>Whatever distrust I had in regard to my
powers as an envoy, I said nothing, for in
case of an order a soldier has no alternative
but to obey. Had I been in the governor’s
place I should have sent an older man.</p>

<p>I received my credentials at Williamsburg,
and rode away the day after, October
31, 1753, intending no delay.</p>

<p>Van Braam was assigned to me as my
French interpreter, and I gathered my outfit
of provisions, blankets, and guns at Alexandria,
and horses, tents, and other needed
matters at Winchester, and was joined near
Wills Creek—where now is the settlement
called Cumberland—by Mr. Gist and an Indian
interpreter, one Davidson.</p>

<p>The same day, November 13, to my pleasure,
Lord Fairfax rode into camp and
spent the night. It was raining and at times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
snowing, but Gist soon set up a lean-to, and
with our feet to the fire we talked late into
the night, his lordship smoking, as was his
habit.</p>

<p>I have many times desired to be able to
make drawings of the greater trees, but,
although I could plot a survey well, beyond
this I could never go. I speak of this because
of my remembrance of that night, and
how mighty the trees seemed by the campfire
light around the clearing. It was his
lordship who called my attention to the
trees. He had a way, most strange to me,
of suddenly dropping the matter in hand
before it was fully considered. He would
be silent a space and speak no more, or turn
presently to another matter most remote.
All of this I learned to accept without remonstrance,
out of respect for this great
gentleman, as was fitting in one of my
years. I never got accustomed to his ways,
for it has been always my desire to deal
with the subject in hand fully and to an
end. Nor did I see this wilderness as his
lordship saw it; for, while I made note of
trees for what logs they would afford, and
as to the soil and the lay of the land, his
lordship I have seen stand for ten minutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
looking at a great tree as though he found
much to consider of it. In like manner I
have seen him stop when the hounds were
in full cry, a thing most astonishing, and
sit still in the saddle, looking down at a
brook or up at the sunrise.</p>

<p>As we lay by the fire he remained without
speaking for a long while, until the men,
having found some old and dried birch logs,
cast them on the fire, and a great roaring
red flame lighted the woods and was blown
about by the cold wind. His lordship said,
“See, George, how the shadows of the trees
are dancing”—a thing very wild, that I
never should have much noticed had not
he called on me to observe it. After this
he was silent until suddenly he began to ask
questions as to my men and my route, and
what I meant to do and say in the French
camps. At last he said, “You are going
to stir up a nest of hornets,” and, finally,
that the former messenger, Trent, was a
coward.</p>

<p>When he had again been silent a long
while, he said that this time, at least, he was
not responsible for my appointment, and
Dinwiddie was a fool to send a boy on a
man’s errand. This was my own opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
but I made no reply. At last he filled his
pipe again, and called for a coal, and said,
“But by George, George, you never were
a boy, not since I knew you.” I ventured
to say that but for his former influence this
office would not have come to me. To this
he made no answer, but bid me distrust
every Indian, especially the Half-King, who
was not treacherous but uncertain, and not
less every Frenchman, and added that I was
so young that they would think that I could
be easily fooled. I said that might be an
advantage, for I meant to see all there was
to see, and had told Van Braam to keep his
ears open.</p>

<p>His lordship laughed, and said I might
thank Heaven there were no women in the
business, and with this, bidding me have
the fire made up for the night, we lay down
to sleep in the lean-to.</p>

<p>I find it interesting now in my old age to
discover myself thus able to recall, little by
little, what his lordship said. I was pleased
at the notice he took of me, but a lad, and
lay long awake under the lean-to, thinking
upon such counsels as his lordship had been
pleased to give.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">As I turn over the diary in which I recorded
my journey through this wilderness,
I find myself remembering many
little incidents which I never set down.</p>

<p>It rained or snowed almost daily. The
rivers were swollen, so that we had to swim
our horses, an art which soldiers should be
taught. Although Van Braam much enlivened
the way by his songs and very
doubtful tales of his wars, I was very tired
and my new buckskin coat in tatters when
we arrived at the mouth of Turtle Creek on
the Monongahela. There we found Frazier,
a trader whom the French had driven out
of the Indian town of Venango. With two
canoes he lent me I sent our baggage down
the Monongahela to the fork, where, with
the Alleghany River, it joins the Ohio, and
set out on a bad trail to meet them.</p>

<p>We got to the Forks of the Ohio before
the canoes. There, I settled in my mind,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
was the place for a fort, nor could I better
that judgment to-day. It came afterwards
to be chosen by the French engineer Mercier
to be Fort Duquesne. On the rise of
ground we made camp, and paid a visit to
Shingiss of the Delawares, who pretended
to favour us, but proved later a savage foe.</p>

<p>Gist insisted that he could tell from their
faces how the Indians felt towards us, but
to me they told nothing, and are in this respect
unlike the faces of white men.</p>

<p>We got to Logstown, fifteen miles down
the Ohio, on November 24. Here I met the
Indian known as the Half-King. He was
angry at the French claims, and I did not
too strongly put forward those of the King,
which were not much better founded; but
that was for my superiours to decide. I
found him hard to satisfy, but if I spoke of
the French he was at once angered, and
eager to help. I watched with interest as
he drew with charcoal on birch bark the
plan of their forts at French Creek and on
Lake Erie, while Davidson interpreted his
words.</p>

<p>The nearest way was impassable because
of marshy savannas, and I found I must
needs travel north so as to reach the lake,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
by passing through Venango. This, the
Half-King informed me, was five sleeps distant,
and expressed it by five times drawing
up his hands, as a man does when pulling
up his blankets before sleeping.</p>

<p>It was fortunately arranged that the
Half-King, White Thunder, and two more
chiefs should go with me. It was but seventy
miles to Venango, but the weather
could not have been worse, and so it was
December 4 before we rode into the clearing
the French had made around the big log
house out of which they had driven the
trader John Frazier.</p>

<p>I recall what is not set down in my diary,
the anger and shame with which I saw the
flag of France flying over the big cabin.
As I came out of the woods, a lean, dark-faced
man came forward with three French
officers, and I learned that he was Captain
Joncaire, the worst enemy we had, for he
was a half-breed and had the tongues of
the Indians. He said he had command on
the Ohio, but we must push on to see his
general. He was very merry, and laughed
every minute or two, but was on his guard
like the others.</p>

<p>Three days passed before I could get
away, with La Force, the guide they gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
me, and three soldiers for escort. Meanwhile
Joncaire entertained us at a supper.
I never had better cause to be thankful for
my sobriety, which was a rare virtue at that
day, and even later, among all classes. The
big log cabin had a great table set out with
game and French kickshaws, such as were
strange to me. None of the French spoke
English nor understood it, and of my
people Van Braam alone had any French.
They all dosed themselves freely with
wine and brandy, and pretty soon the
French felt it and began to give their
tongues license and to brag and talk loosely.
I was never more amused in all my life, for
as Joncaire boasted of what they meant to
do, Van Braam, who was an old soldier with
a head used to potations, chattered what
seemed to be a kind of French, which set
the drunken fools a-laughing. Amid all the
noise, and the smoke which nearly choked
me, Van Braam now and then spoke to
me, telling me what they said, and of their
mind to seize and hold the country. Next
day he was still more full as to their
talk, and did me a service, which, in spite
of the hurt he innocently did me later, I
never forgot.</p>

<p>I was glad to get away at last, for when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
Joncaire found the Half-King, who was hid
away in my camp, which I had made in the
woods at a distance, he got the poor savage
drunk with rum and loaded him with gifts.
Four days later, and very tired, I was at
French Creek, where was a great fort, fifteen
miles from Lake Erie. Much against
my will, Joncaire had sent with me La
Force, as great a lover of mischief as could
be found. This fellow was the leanest man
I ever saw, and saddle-coloured. When he
spoke to me he stared constantly, which is
as unpleasant as to avoid entirely to meet
a man’s gaze. He made no end of trouble,
and had later his reward, and perhaps more
punishment than he deserved.</p>

<p>I met at this station many educated
French officers, such as I was to make welcome
at another time. I could not avoid
to be pleased with the commandant, by
name Legardeur de St. Pierre, a chevalier
of St. Louis. He was an old soldier, very
tall and straight, and with much grey hair,
and had lost an eye in battle. This gentleman
was most courteous, and had brisk,
pleasing ways, very frank and outspoken.
He desired to be remembered to Lord Fairfax,
whom he had known in Paris long ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>The chevalier, by good fortune, spoke
English enough to make his company very
agreeable, and I became sure, as I spent
some days in his society, that he made no
attempt to deceive me; for nothing could
have been more plain than that he meant
to hold the country for his king.</p>

<p>He was pleased to relate his campaigns
in Europe, and, although he was apt, like
old soldiers, to be lengthy as to these, I
found him to be instructive.</p>

<p>He talked lightly of women, but so did
his officers, and in a manner we in Virginia
should have considered to be unmannerly
or worse. Also he told me that the French
encouraged their soldiers to take wives
among the young squaws, a thing our people
never inclined to do. He seemed to
have known many English gentlemen who
had been in Paris, and even why Lord Fairfax
had left England, all of which story I
could have heard from him if I had thought
proper so to do, which I did not. He did
say, and was very merry about it, that if a
woman drove his lordship to America, another
might drive him back, for, after all,
we were only shuttlecocks, and were knocked
to and fro by the women—and I might say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
so to his lordship with the chevalier’s compliments.</p>

<p>I remember that when, after this journey,
I had returned home, my sister Betty was
agreeably interested to hear what the chevalier
had said of the old lord, who was the
only person who could keep Betty quiet for
five minutes. I had to answer that I had
not seen fit to inquire further. Upon this
she declared that some day she should ask
his lordship all about it. When I laughed
and made no other reply, she declared that
I was as silent as my lord, and that I had
lost a fine opportunity. I contented myself
with the chevalier’s compliments to Lord
Fairfax, who said if that was all the old
fellow had said he must have changed, for
he was a gossiping old reprobate and fit to
corrupt me. But for my part I liked him
and found him a gallant gentleman, and
only of a mind to serve his king, as I was
to serve mine.</p>

<p>There was no unreasonable delay, for the
chevalier made clear to me that nothing
could be done until after they had held a
council. I arrived on the 12th, and on the
14th they were able to give me a sealed reply
to the governor’s summons. Meanwhile I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
had been left free to inspect the fort and
count the canoes made ready for use in the
spring. I must admit that they seemed careless
as to what I saw. There were many Indians
and French and half-breeds coming
and going. The fort was square, of logs,
with palisadoes, a forge, and a chapel, all
very neat and clean, and much ceremony
when we came in and went out.</p>

<p class="cap">I was now very eager to go, but notwithstanding
the polite ways of the commandant,
I found needless delays as to
guides and supplies. This was to gain time
to win the Half-King, who was of our side
to-day, and the next had what the Indians
call “two hearts.” I cannot say that ever
in my life I suffered as much anxiety as I
did in this affair. The Half-King, being
half drunk, assured me the chevalier was
keeping him. That officer swore that he
was ignorant why we did not go, but this
I determined not to do without Tanacharisson.
One day a gun was promised the
savage, another day all my sachems were
dead drunk. I was in despair, for to lose
the Half-King to the wiles of the French
would be a serious matter, and I was resolved
not to fail. But here was I, a lad of
twenty-one, playing a game with old, astute
men for the prize of a drunken Indian!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>Finally Gist succeeded in keeping him
sober a day, and yet, as he said, reasonably
intoxicated with promises of great gifts;
and so at last, on December 16, we gladly
bade farewell and set out in our birch
canoes to go down French Creek.</p>

<p>A cannon was fired, and the officers assembled
on shore saluted us politely as we
left the fort. The commandant sent one
canoe loaded with strong liquors to be used
on the way, and at Venango to overcome the
wits of Tanacharisson.</p>

<p>Each of us, Gist and Van Braam and
Davidson, was seated very comfortably in
the middle of a canoe of birch bark; at the
bow and stern were Indians or half-breeds,
and, as the water was very rapid most of the
way, they used poles of ash to hold and
guide the canoes. On the 18th December
we were no longer comfortable. The ice
was thick, and we had all of us to wade and,
in places, to portage. On the 22d we came
to a strong rapid. Gist advised to land and
portage the provisions. This we did, and,
being arrived before the French canoes,
stood to watch them descend, a fine sight.
About half-way the man on the bow of one
canoe—that with the liquors—caught his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
pole between two rocks. He should have
let it go; but as he did not, the boat slued
square to the stream and, filling, turned
over, so that all the brandy was lost, to my
satisfaction. The men got out, with no
great ease, swearing oaths, both French and
Indian.</p>

<p>It rained and froze, and when, at fall of
night, we came to Venango on December
22, we were cased in ice like men in armour.
I was never more glad of a fire.</p>

<p>Here Captain Chabert de Joncaire set to
work again to convince my Half-King with
the bottle. But by good luck the sachem
was much disordered in his stomach because
of the rum he had of St. Pierre, and when
Gist persuaded him the French had bewitched
the liquor, he would none of it.
Here we found our horses, but very lean,
and, after a rest, set out by land from Venango,
over a bad trail, this being about
December 25.</p>

<p>It was a horrible journey, the men getting
frozen feet and the packhorses failing,
until, in despair at the delay, on the third
day, against Gist’s advice, I left Van
Braam to follow me with the horses and
men, and determined to strike through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
woods by compass to the Forks of the Ohio,
and thus be enabled the sooner to report to
the governor.</p>

<p>For this venture Gist and I put on match-coats,
Indian dress, thick socks, and moccasins.
We carried packs, with my papers
tied up in tanned skin, and as much provision
as we could manage. With our guns,
and thus cumbered, we left the camp and
struck out through the woods, where to
move by compass is no easy matter, because
to go straight is not possible where
every tree and bit of swamp must turn a
man to this side or that. But by taking
note of some great pine in front of us, and,
on reaching it, of another, we made good
progress, and for part of the way we had
an Indian trail.</p>

<p>On the third day, the snow being deep,
we struck up the southeast fork of Beaver
Creek. Here were a few Indians camped,
who seemed to expect us, but how they
could have done this I never knew; but
there is much about Indian ways of communication
of which I must confess myself
ignorant.</p>

<p>They were too curious to please Gist; but
as we were now in midwinter, and to pass<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
through a wilderness with no trails, we engaged,
for we could do no better, an Indian
as guide and to carry my pack. Gist mistrusted
him, and I soon shared his opinion.</p>

<p>We left at break of day, and after ten
miles were in doubt as to our route, I with
one foot chafed and the most tired I ever
was in my life, on account of plunging
through drifts, where, on his snow-shoes,
the Indian was at ease. At this time he
would have carried my gun, but I refused.
When we said we would camp and rest, he
declared the Ottawas would see our fire-smoke
and surprise us. Upon this we kept
on, as he said, toward his cabin. Once he
told Gist he heard whoops, and then a gun,
and kept turning northward, to our discontent.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my fatigue, I found the
loneliness and silence of these woods to my
taste, being open and free of undergrowth.
I was startled at times by the sharp crack,
like a pistol-shot, of huge limbs breaking,
but there was no other sound.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXI">XXI</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">At last I declared that I must camp at
the first brook we met, and so kept on,
stumbling, and ready to fall down with
fatigue. At this time, being come some two
miles farther into warm sunlight and an
open glade, all the brighter for the whiteness
of the snow, I came to a stand and
said, “Here is our stream; let us camp.”
At this time Gist and I were near together,
and the Indian about twenty paces away.
Of a sudden he turned and fired at us. I
cried out to Gist if he was shot. He said
no, and we ran in on the fellow before he
could load, and seized him and took his
gun. Gist was for killing him at once, but
this I would not allow, and we contented
ourselves with taking his gun, and made
him walk on in front. Gist, who was much
vexed, said if we did not shoot him, which
was the better way, we must contrive to
fool him. At last it was agreed to pretend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
we believed his excuses as to the shooting
being an accident, and to let him go to his
cabin. He said he knew we would never
trust him further, and was pleased to be
told he might go home and get some jerked
venison ready, and that we would camp
that night and follow his tracks in the snow
at morning. We returned his gun, but took
all his powder. We gave him a cake of
bread, and Gist followed him until he had
gone a mile. After my companion came
back to me, we moved on rapidly for an
hour and made a big fire, and, as it was
night, took, by the light of the blaze, a
course by compass, and set out, leaving, to
my regret, the great warm flame behind us.</p>

<p>It was now clear and very cold. All night
long we pushed on, now and then making a
light with flint and steel to see the compass,
and trying to observe the stars. We were
well assured that we should be pursued,
and on this account never halted the next
day, and hardly spoke a word until, at
evening, we came upon the Alleghany
River.</p>

<p>There we made camp, and were up at
break of day.</p>

<p>The ice lay out some sixty feet from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
two shores, and between were masses of
ice afloat and a great flow of water. Having
only one hatchet, and that not very
good, we were all day contriving to build
a raft. At sundown we pushed it over the
shore ice and got afloat. Midway we got
caught in the jam of ice-cakes, and as I
pushed with my setting-pole, the swift current
and a block of ice caught it, and I was
cast into the deep water. I caught on to
a log of the raft, and Gist giving me a hand,
I crawled on to the raft. I had lost my
pole, and to go to either shore was not possible,
and when we drifted on to an island
I was thankful enough, and the raft swept
away in the flood.</p>

<p>Very soon Gist had a great fire burning,
and by this I dried myself; but to keep
warm was impossible, for the cold was the
greatest I have ever known, and so intense
was it that Gist would not allow me to sleep,
but made me walk about, although I was
ready to drop, saying if we slept and the
fire should die, so should we. By good fortune
there was a large jam of drifted wood
on the upper end of the island, and thus
we had fuel sufficient.</p>

<p>What with fatigue and the cold increasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
as the night went on, even Gist, who
was of great endurance and hopeful, was
concerned lest we should have been followed,
and, as the island afforded small
shelter, be shot from the shore. This troubled
me less than to keep warm, for there
was not snow enough to build a hut, than
which there is no better shelter.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock that night we found
that the river was rising, so that it would
take little more to flood us. What I found
worst of all was the delay. I said things
could hardly be worse, but that the cold
was such as would freeze the river by daylight.
He said that was true, and we went
back to the fire and shared a part of a flask
of brandy St. Pierre gave me. Fortunately
we had food enough. Gist kept me and
himself awake with amazing stories of Indians
and French, and of great bears. But,
contrive as we could, Gist had his toes froze,
and had to have them rubbed with snow to
save them. I was well pleased at last to see
red in the sky to eastward, and when we
found the ice-cakes froze hard together we
made haste to cross to the shore. There,
being out of shot and the sun warmer every
minute, we built another fire and ate breakfast,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
and took, each in turn, an hour’s
sleep.</p>

<p>As we walked away, Gist said there was
small fear of Indians either in the darkness
or in great cold, for they liked neither, and
he thought the cold had perhaps saved us
from pursuit.</p>

<p>This was the case at Valley Forge in
’78, when, although my soldiers suffered
greatly, the snows and the cold were such
as to keep Sir William Howe in his lines.</p>

<p>From the top of a hill, as I looked back
on the river, Gist said: “You will never
again, sir, be in a worse business than that,
nor ever see the like again.” But this I
did, when, on the night before Christmas,
in 1776, I crossed the Delaware in a boat
with General Knox, amid as great peril of
ice, on our way to beat up the Hessian quarters
at Trenton.</p>

<p>While we were in danger, Gist had been
silent; but now that we were released from
anxiety and on a clear trail, he talked all
the time, whether I made answer or not.
I remember little of what he said, being
engaged in thinking how soon I should be
able to reach Williamsburg. I recall, however,
his surprising me with a question as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
to whether I had ever before had a man
shoot at me. I said never, and having my
mind thus turned to the matter, felt it to
be strange that so great an escape and such
nearness to death had not more impressed
me. But, in fact, I had no time to think
before we caught the man, and after that
the great misery of the cold so distressed
me that how to keep warm employed my
mind.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">We were now on a good trail, and by
nightfall came to the cabin of Frazier,
a trader in furs; and this was where
the Turtle Creek falls into the Monongahela.
Here I wrote up my diary.</p>

<p>As there was hope of packhorses coming
hither which might be used on our return,
I waited, pleased to be fed and warmed,
but hearing bad news of massacres by the
Ottawas. Near by I visited the Queen Aliquippa,
and made her presents of a match-coat
and a bottle of rum I had of the trader,
asking, too, her advice as to the Indians, all
of which pleased her mightily.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find a woman with rule
over Indians, but she was said to be wise
in council. I never heard of a King Aliquippa.
The queen was old and fat and
as wrinkled as a frosted persimmon. She
smoked a pipe and had a tomahawk in
her belt, and I did not think she would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
be a comfortable partner in the marriage
state.</p>

<p>At last, as we failed at this place to get
horses after a three days’ rest, we left on
foot, January 1, reaching Gist’s home on
the Monongahela, a sixteen-mile tramp.
There I left Gist, and, buying a horse,
pushed on, passing packhorses carrying
stores for the new fort begun at the Forks.</p>

<p>I had no more appetite for adventure,
and was glad to reach Williamsburg on
January 16, 1754, where I delivered my
sealed reply, and conveyed to the governor
my views, and remembrance of what I had
seen and heard, with maps I had made and
drawings of the forts.</p>

<p>Looking back from the hilltop, as General
Hamilton once said to me, must often
surprise a man with knowledge of mistakes
made by the way; but considering this journey
from the summit of years, I seem to
have done as well as so young a man might.</p>

<p>Van Braam, who came in later, told me
that the elder French officers were rather
amused that a boy should be sent on an
errand which might bring about a war. I
think it was their imprudent indifference
which left me free to observe all I wished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
to learn which might bear upon military
action in the future. It appeared to me that
they felt so secure of their own power as to
be altogether careless.</p>

<p>I proposed to myself on starting to be
as full of wiles as the Indians, and to be
very careful as to what I said to them and
to the French. I perceive to-day that my
disposition to look down on the Indians was
a mistake, and that I had been wiser to have
treated the Half-King more as an equal.
My disposition to be what is called diplomatic
with the French in command was
needless, for the commander was very
frank. I have learned, as years went by,
that in treating with men or nations the
simplest way is the best.</p>

<p>The answer made to the governor was
plain enough. The Frenchmen were there
to obey orders, and meant to hold the lands.
They would, of course, send our summons
to Marquis Duquesne. The chevalier said
in his despatch polite words of me, which
I still recall with satisfaction, for I have
never been insensible to the approbation of
men, and the words of the courteous French
officer were not lost upon me.</p>

<p>The governor thought, and so did his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
council, that the answer was evasive and
was meant to gain time. It seemed to me
remarkably straightforward, and I was sure
that in the spring they would descend the
Ohio and take possession. I had to prepare
my report hastily in two days, which was
printed and distributed through the colonies.
It appears to me, as I read it over,
to have been well done for so young a man,
with no time allowed to correct and improve
the language. I am more surprised,
as I now read it, that I should have had the
good sense to see, as the French engineers
saw later, that where the Monongahela and
Alleghany join was the best place for a fort,
and a better than where the Ohio Company
intended.</p>

<p>It seems strange to me, as I look back on
this time, to see what share I, but a young
man, had in the historical events of the day.
My report was not only read throughout
the colonies, but in England and even in
France, so that at this time, and again soon
after, my name became known both among
ourselves and on the other side of the ocean,
although the matters in which I was engaged
were in themselves, to appearance, of
little moment. To be so widely spoken of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
was not then unpleasant, and the less so
because it was a source of gratification to
my friends.</p>

<p>I had been through the winter wilderness
and delivered the hostile message of the
King’s governor. It was seemingly no great
matter. But as I reflect, I perceive that
whatever I did then or later gave me such
importance in the eyes of men as led on to
my being considered for the greater tasks
of life. Mr. J——, who much disliked General
H——, once wrote of him that he was
like a pawn in the game of chess, and was
pushed on by mere luck, until he suddenly
found himself on the far line of the board
with the powers of royalty. This was said
with bitterness not long ago, when I insisted
he should command under me, at the
time we were threatened with a French war.
I am not, however, of the opinion that good
fortune alone presides over the destinies
either of men or nations, for often in after
days I have had cause to believe that an intending
Providence was concerned in the
events of the great war.</p>

<p>As soon as I had made an end of my
business with the governor, I visited my
mother, and thence rode to Mount Vernon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
There I found Lord Fairfax, and was
pleased to be rested and to hear his lordship
speak well of my conduct of a difficult
affair. When we were alone next day on
horseback, he rode long in silence, as was
his way. When he spoke he said: “George,
I have sent for copies of your report to
send to my friends in England. It is well
done. I am pleased that you would not talk
much of it last night to Colonel Willis and
Mr. Warner. The men who do not talk
about themselves are the most talked about
by others. Silence often insures praise.”
Indeed, even thus early and since, I have
been averse to speak of what I had done.
I replied that I should remember his lordship’s
advice, upon which he went on to
talk of the chances of war with France. I
was not left long idle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXIII">XXIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The governor was now fully decided to
resist the French aggressions, and
convened the House of Burgesses after
much delay. I was offered full command
of a force of three hundred men in six
companies, forming a regiment. I consulted
his lordship and my half-brother Augustine
as to this, and not feeling secure of
my fitness for so great a position, and they
agreeing, I chose rather to serve as second
under Colonel Frye. This being settled, I
went about the business of recruiting as
lieutenant-colonel.</p>

<p>In considering the new duty to which I
was called and what it led me to do, I have
asked myself whether I could have done
it better, considering the want of supplies
and of sufficiency of men.</p>

<p>Mr. John Langdon at one time wrote to
me, when commenting on the character of
General A——, that what he had been as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
a very young man he continued to be ever
after, and that, although education and opportunity
might give a man of strong character
the tools for his purposes, they would
not seriously alter his nature; he would
only be more and more that which he had
been.</p>

<p>As I sit in judgment upon the particulars
which occasioned the affair at Great
Meadows, and later my disaster at Fort Necessity,
I am inclined to believe that I could
have done no better at fifty than I did at
twenty-two. I perceive also that the conditions
which at that time surrounded and
embarrassed me were on a lesser scale the
same as those with which I had to struggle
in the later and more important days, which
made me old before my time. Such comparisons
as these do not readily occur to
me, as I am inclined to dwell most upon the
needs of the present and upon the possibilities
which the future may have in store.</p>

<p>On one occasion, during the march to
Yorktown, when bivouacked at the head of
the Elk, Colonel Scammel and Lieutenant-Colonel
Hugh Wynne, both at that time of
my military family, led me into expressing
myself as to these earlier events, and one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
them, Lieutenant-Colonel Wynne, I think,
remarked that I had then to encounter the
same kind of obstacles as those which had
perplexed me at the Valley Forge and Morristown,
and indeed throughout the War of
Independency. I did not encourage such
further discussion by these young officers as
might readily lead on to the impropriety of
criticisms upon Congress. But now, recalling
what was then said, I am led to see how
remarkably alike were the conditions I had
to meet at two periods of my life. Nor can
I fail to observe that what General Hamilton
liked very often to call “the education
of events” was valuable in teaching me
moderation and such control of temper as
I was to need on a larger field.</p>

<p>While I went about my military preparations,
the governor and the House wrangled
over the ten thousand pounds he asked for
the fitting out of troops. I have observed
that men engaged in agriculture as the masters
of slaves acquire a great independence
of thought and are hard to move to a common
agreement even when, as at that time,
there is an immediate need for united
action.</p>

<p>There was also much distrust of Governor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Dinwiddie, and indeed we rarely submitted
with entire good will to any of the
royal governors. He got his grant at last,
but a committee was to confer with him as
to how it was to be used—a measure not
altogether unwise, but which made him
swear we were getting to be too republican
and, he feared, would be more and more difficult
to be brought to order.</p>

<p>As to my recruiting, the better men were
indisposed to join, and I got chiefly a vagabond
crew of shoeless, half-dressed fellows,
but most of them hunters and good shots.
I did better when the governor offered a
bounty in land, which as yet we had not, for
it was to be about the fine bottoms at the
Forks of the Ohio, which were in the hands
of the French and the Indians.</p>

<p>I made Van Braam a captain, and thereafter
obtained more men and better, for the
old warrior promised, I fear, an easy time
and all manner of agreeable rewards, with
such accounts of the lands they were to
have as much delighted the hard-working
farmers’ sons.</p>

<p>On April 2 I left Alexandria, with orders
to secure tools and build roads, for Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Frye to follow me with the artillery and a
greater force.</p>

<p>In what I was thus set to do I knew I
was to have difficulty, and this it was hard
to make Governor Dinwiddie understand,
nor do I think he or our rulers in England
could form any idea of the country to be
traversed, even up to the Forks of the Ohio.
From our outlying farms westward to the
Mississippi was a great forest land with
savannas, and beyond the Ohio vast meadows
where buffalo grazed. Through our
own hills there were old Indian trails, and
as far as to the Ohio were horse-paths used
by the traders and their men. There were
also many crossing-trails made by horned
game to reach water, and apt to mislead
any but men accustomed to the woods.
Very few knew this mighty wilderness, nor
was it easy to make persons unused to the
woods comprehend the obstacles and risks
an army would find on traversing them with
waggons and artillery.</p>

<p>As I have said, I had long ago fixed upon
the Forks of the Ohio as an excellent station
for a fort. The French were also of
this opinion, and in their hands it became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
at last Fort Duquesne, and in 1759 was
lightly given up by them to General Forbes.
At this earlier date our governor, resolving
to take my advice, made choice of Captain
Trent to build a fort at the Forks, where we
prepared to follow and support him. Having
failed on a former and easier errand, it
was foolish to have expected better things
of this man in a more difficult matter. He
was given only fifty men, as it was supposed
he would not be attacked.</p>

<p>While I was on my way to Wills Creek
from Winchester, Contrecœur dropped
down-stream from Venango with a great
force and took the half-finished fort, Captain
Trent being absent at the time. I was
near to Wills Creek when I learned of this
disaster. Colonel Frye and other detachments
were to follow me, but I saw that
we were now in a way to be devoured in
bits by the larger French forces. Everything
I needed was lacking. I had been
cursed along the border for my taking of
waggons, horses, and food, and when I
would have picks, shovels, and axes, it was
worse.</p>

<p>I heard while here from Mr. Fairfax, desiring
me not to neglect having divine service
in the camps for the benefit of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
Indians. I did on one occasion, but as
Davidson told me they considered it some
form of incantation, I did not repeat it. I
had also a letter from my mother, meant
to have found me earlier. It seemed
strange amid anxieties like mine to be asked
to send her a good Dutch servant and, if
I remember correctly, four pounds of
good Dutch butter. I had far other business.</p>

<p>At the Ohio Company’s post at Wills
Creek, nothing was ready; only Captain
Trent, full of excuses for the failure of
horses and boats, and much cast down at
the news of the loss of the fort. I sent
back for waggons and horses sixty miles to
Winchester, and waited as patiently as I
could.</p>

<p>On April 23 came the men of Trent’s
party, released by the French. The ensign,
Mr. Ward, was the only officer with them,
and to surrender was all he could do. He
told me of hundreds of Chippewas and Ottawas
coming to join Contrecœur, and of
another force descending the Ohio. To add
to my troubles, Trent’s men were disorderly,
making my men uneasy by their
stories.</p>

<p>At this time I was decently housed in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
small log hut, and here, retiring by myself,
I fell to thinking of what I had heard and
what I ought to do. The situation demanded
serious consideration, but also
speedy action.</p>

<p class="cap">I had been sent forward to build bridges,
to corduroy swamps for the cannon, and
to make roads. I was not to bring on hostilities,
but I was to assert the King’s title
and, at need, to resist the French. The orders
were well fitted to get me into trouble,
but the capture of Trent’s fort and men
somewhat aided my decision, for this was
an act of open war. While thus occupied,
a runner fetched me letters, and among
them one from Lord Fairfax.</p>

<p>As adjutant of the Northern Division
since I was nineteen, I was prepared for
much that his lordship’s letter conveyed,
but it went in some respects beyond what
I then knew or was prepared for, and, I may
add also, much beyond the views which
his lordship came later to entertain, when
men were obliged to elect as between loyalty
to the King and disloyalty to human
rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>This letter now before me runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><i>Greenway Court.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear George</span>: Yours received from Alexandria,
and thank you for the attention when
you were so busily engaged. I am always pleased
to be acquainted with anything to your advantage,
and was gratified at your being chosen to be
of the force. I desire you, however, to understand
that your worst enemies will not be the
French, or the fickle Indians, but those in the
rear.</p>

<p>There is of late years a great desire for freedom
in all the colonies, and men are disposed
to dispute the too royal sense of prerogative
on the part of the governors. Whenever, as
now, money is to be voted, the houses in the
several colonies are apt to use the occasion to
dispute it, and to bargain for something else as a
reward for their grant of supplies. The withholding
of money has been the chief means of
governing kings by our own Commons. I blame
it not. But this present reluctance is without
cause—foolish, and at a wrong season. As to
the difficulty of disciplining our people you know
enough, and will know more; but they will
always fight, which may console for other defects.
The want of an organized commissary
you will feel of a surety, but less than with regulars,
who do not know as do our people how to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
diet their English bellies, or how to forage at
need on wood and river. Prepare, too, for desertion
and drunkenness, which is the curse of
the land. But I must forbear, lest I discourage
you, although that I consider not to be easy. I
would that you smoked a pipe. It confers great
equanimity in times of doubt, and the Indians
hold it to be helpful in council; for while a man
smokes he cannot discourse, and thus must needs
obtain time for sober reflection, for which reason
it would be well that women took to the pipe,
a custom which would greatly conduce to comfort
in the condition of armed neutrality known
as the married state. Charles Sedley once said
in my company that the pipe was the bachelor’s
hearth, and I have found it a good one. Indeed,
my dear George, when I reflect upon the many
statues of worthless kings and the monuments to
scoundrels in graveyards where the dead lie and
the living lie about them, I am inclined to set up
a fine memorial at Greenway Court to the unknown
Indian who invented this blessing of the
Pipe. He must have been a great genius.</p>

<p>Wishing you the best of luck, and that I were
young enough to be with you, I am,</p>

<p class="padr2">Yours,</p>

<p class="right"><i>Fairfax</i>.</p>

<p>P. S. You will at some time have to serve
with regulars or with colonial officers appointed
by the crown. Your sense of justice and of what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
is due to a gentleman will, I am assured, revolt at
the want of parity in pay and at other claims to
outrank gentlemen of the colonies serving in the
militia. As to this I counsel moderation and endurance.
Your first duty must be to the crown.</p>

<p>It was raining heavily as I sat that night
and considered what I should do. To fall
back I had no mind. I had been set to the
slow work of preparing roads, and had
made them up to the west branch of the
Youghiogheny, about four miles a day, and
here meant to make a bridge. As I sat in
the log cabin alone, deciding what next to
do, came in Van Braam with a warning
from the Half-King, and, just after, a
trader who had been driven out by the
French and who told me that a force sent
from Duquesne was at least eight hundred
in number. This I was sure could not be
the case, and until I knew more I could not
decide what to do. I asked to be alone, and
with a candle and a rude map considered
the situation. I concluded that the French
would make no considerable move forward
until they had made secure the excellent
position they had taken from Trent. I was
of opinion they would meanwhile send out
small parties to scout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>After a council with my officers, we resolved
to go on to fortify a post of the Ohio
Company at Redstone Creek, near the
Monongahela, and after sending back urgent
letters we set out, doing the best we
could as to the road. On May 9, at Little
Meadows, we were met by many traders,
driven in by the French, with tales which
much discouraged my men—in all some two
hundred; and still I pushed on to the
Youghiogheny, and there kept the men busy
with the bridging of it. Leaving them occupied
in this manner, I explored the
Youghiogheny for a better way by water
than over the hills, but found it impracticable,
and so came back to do as best I
could with the road over the mountains.</p>

<p>That night I was again called on for a
decision. I remember I walked to and fro,
considering how it was but an outpost, with
nothing near in the way of succour, and before
me the French and the wilderness.</p>

<p>Van Braam, whom I had sent out to
scout, had before this appeared, bringing
news that, eighteen miles below, the French
were crossing by a ford, their number unknown;
also that several of our men had
deserted and that there was much uneasiness
in the camp. I was myself quite uneasy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
enough. Many times since I have
been in as doubtful and perilous situations,
where the fate of an empire was concerned,
but then I have had with me officers of distinction.
I was alone, hardly more than a
boy, and surrounded by men who were becoming
alarmed.</p>

<p>I said to Van Braam that we must not be
caught here, but that I would not fall back
very far. The old trooper smiled, and I
confess to having been pleased by this sign
of approval. My mind was made up not to
return to the settlements except before an
overwhelming force.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXV">XXV</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On May 23, six more men being gone
away, I retreated to Great Meadows,
a wide, open space free of large trees, a
charming place for an encounter, and here
I cleared the ground of bushes, began a log
fort, and prepared to remain until I heard
further. This I did very soon, for Gist, the
trader, came in on the 25th of May with
news of my old acquaintance, La Force,
having been at his camp, at noon the day
before, with some fifty men, and one, De
Jumonville, in command. They were foolish
enough not to hold Gist, for he got off
and warned me of their being not five miles
from us. They had been sending runners
back to Contrecœur, and what were their
intentions Gist did not know. That night I
got news of my doubtful Half-King, who
promised help if I would attack this party.</p>

<p>Whatever indecision I have had in my life
of warfare has been due to a too great respect
for the opinions of other officers, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
very often I had done better to have gone
my own way. All day long I had been in
the melancholic state of mind which at
times all my life has troubled me. I remember
that the news from Gist of this
prowling band so near as five miles, and
the word sent by the Half-King, at once put
to rout my lowness of mind. Usually young
officers go into their first battle under more
experienced guidance, and I now wonder
at the confidence with which I set out, for
some of my officers were clear against it.</p>

<p>I felt sure that De Jumonville would attack
me if I retreated, or, if I let him alone,
would wait for further help and orders from
Contrecœur before making an end of my little
party. That I was to strike openly the
forces of the King of France did not disturb
me, after their seizure of our fort at
the Forks.</p>

<p>When I told Van Braam and Gist what I
meant to do, the former approved, but Gist
would have had me retreat to Wills Creek.
I said no; we would surely be ambushed,
and the men were deserting.</p>

<p>Having given my orders, I tied an extra
pair of moccasins to my belt, and taking
no gun myself, set out at 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
behind me a baggage-guard. I took with
me forty men, the best I had, and mostly
good shots. The Half-King and a few warriors
in full war-paint met me at a spring
some two miles away.</p>

<p>His scouts had found the French in a
rocky valley, where they had cleared a space
and evidently meant to await orders or reinforcements.</p>

<p>The rain was pouring down in torrents,
the worst that could be, when we met the
Half-King. We halted in the darkness of
the forest while my interpreter let me know
the situation of De Jumonville, which
seemed to me to be well chosen as a hiding-place,
but ill contrived for defence.
After this we pushed on, the Indian guides
being ahead. Several times they lost their
way. We stumbled on in the wet woods,
falling against one another, so dark was
the night, and crawling under or over the
rotten trees of a windfall. I was both eager
and anxious, and kept on in front, or at
times fell back to silence my men. We were
moving so slowly that my anxiety continually
increased, and I had constantly to
warn my men to keep their flint-locks dry.</p>

<p>At last, toward dawn of day, we came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
where we could look down on the camp.
The wind being in our faces, we had smelt
the smoke of their fires a quarter of a mile
away, and now and then, even at this distant
day, the smell of the smoke from wet
wood smouldering in the rain recalls to
my mind this night, a fact which appears to
me singular. To my joy, the camp was silent
and there were no sentinels. I halted
the men, and my orders were whispered
down the trail for them to scatter to the
right while the Indians moved to the left.
After giving time for this, I moved out
alone from the shelter of the rocks and trees.
As I did so, a man came from a hut and
gave a great shout. At once the French
were out with their arms and began to fire,
but had no cover. Some of my own men
were practised Indian-fighters and kept to
the shelter of the trees, moving from trunk
to trunk and firing very deliberately. I
heard the enemy’s bullets whizz around me,
and felt at once and for the first time in
war the strange exhilaration of danger. A
man fell at my side, and I called to those
near me to keep to the trees, but did not
myself fall back, feeling it well to encourage
my men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>For a little while the firing was hot. It
lasted, however, but fifteen minutes. Then
I saw an officer fall, and they gave up and
cried for quarter as I ran down into their
camp to stop the Indians from using their
tomahawks and killing the wounded.</p>

<p>Van Braam told me afterwards that I
exposed myself needlessly, but I thought
this was necessary in order to give spirit
and confidence to men who were many of
them new to battle.</p>

<p>Our loss was small and that of the French
great, since De Jumonville, who was in
command, and ten men were killed and
twenty-two taken, with some others hurt.</p>

<p>I remember to have written my brother
Jack of this little fight, that the whistle of
the bullets was pleasing to me; but I was
then very young, and it was, after all, but
a way of saying that the sense of danger,
or risk, was agreeable.</p>

<p>On our way back through the woods I
talked to La Force, who was in no wise cast
down and told me that I should pay dear
for my success, and how innocent they were,
and a fine string of lies.</p>

<p>I was very well pleased to have caught
this fellow, one of the most wily and troublesome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
half-breeds on the frontier, and a
fine maker of mischief, as he had been when
I was on my way to the lake.</p>

<p>After the fight we found, on the person
of De Jumonville and in his hut, papers
amply proving his hostile intention, although
even without this evidence his hiding
so long in our neighbourhood, and
sending out runners to Fort Duquesne, sufficiently
showed what my party had to expect
when the French would be reinforced.</p>

<p>After the fight it was thought prudent
to return as soon as possible, so, to my
regret, I had to leave the dead, both our
own and the French, without decent burial.
This I believe they had later at the hand
of De Villiers. Although the fugitives were
nearly all taken, one or two escaped and
took the news to Contrecœur, at the Forks
of the Ohio. I sent my prisoners to Williamsburg
under a strong guard, having
previously supplied M. Drouillon, a young
officer, and La Force with clothes of my
own out of the very little I had. I remember
that I was amused when Drouillon, a
pert little fellow, complained that my shirt
was too big for him. Indeed, it came down
near to his ankles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>I asked of the governor in a letter such
respect and favour for these persons as
was due to gentlemen placed in their unfortunate
condition. Neither of them seemed
to me to have been aware of the character
of their commander’s orders. To my regret,
the request I made to Governor Dinwiddie
received small consideration, as I
may have to relate. I was of opinion, however,
that La Force should not be set free
too soon, because of his power to influence
the Indians.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">The action with De Jumonville took
place on May 28, and the Half-King,
although disappointed as to scalps, went
away, promising to return with many warriors.
He told me his friends the English
had now at last begun in earnest, but that
it was no good war to keep prisoners.</p>

<p>As I trusted him more than most of the
Indians, I sent thirty men and some horses
to assist in moving the Indian families, for
without them the warriors would never return;
and I did not neglect to send a runner
back to hasten Mackay, who was in command
of an independent company from
South Carolina. They were indeed quite
independent, having neither good sense nor
discipline, as I was soon to discover. My
little skirmish with the French on May 28
added to my perplexities the knowledge that
as soon as the runners who escaped should
reach the fort at the Forks Contrecœur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
would undertake to avenge the loss of his
officer.</p>

<p>While I was impatiently waiting supplies
from Croghan at Wills Creek, for now we
were six days without flour, came news that
Colonel Frye, my commander, was dead at
that post. Colonel Innes of North Carolina,
who was to succeed him in the whole command,
lay at Winchester with four hundred
men; but as he continued to lie there, neither
he nor his troops were of any use in the
campaign.</p>

<p>During the period which elapsed between
my fight on May 28 and my being attacked
on July 3, being now a colonel, and sure of
soon being reinforced, I made haste to complete
the fort at Great Meadows.</p>

<p>There I had excellent help from Captain
Stobo and Mr. Adam Stephen, whom I
made captain, and who, long after, became
a general and served under me in the
great war.</p>

<p>It was only a log work we built, near to
breast-high, with no roof, one hundred
feet square, with partitions, and surrounded
at some distance by a too shallow ditch and
palisadoes. Captain Stobo gave to this defence
the name of Fort Necessity, and said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
that the name was suggested by his empty
belly, for indeed we were at this time half
starved.</p>

<p>Near about this time came three hundred
men from Wills Creek, and, to my satisfaction,
my friend Dr. Craik, who was of a
merry disposition, and kept us in good humour,
besides what aid he gave us as a physician,
and I never had the service of a
better.</p>

<p>On the 9th of June arrived my old military
teacher, Adjutant Muse, with other
men, nine swivels, and a very small supply
of ammunition. He fetched with him
a wampum belt and presents and medals
for the Indians, as I had desired of the
governor.</p>

<p>At this time, in order to secure the Indians,
who are fickle and must always be
bribed, we had a fine ceremony, and I delivered
a speech sent from the governor.</p>

<p>Dr. Craik gave me, two years ago, the account
he wrote home of this occasion, and
I leave it in this place for the time, since
it serves to record matters of which I have
no distinct remembrance, and is better wrote
than it would have been by me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Anne</span>: To-day, before we move on, I
send you a letter by a runner who returns to
hasten our supplies. We had a great ceremony
to-day. A space in the meadows near the fort
was cleared, and all our men set around under
arms in a great circle. In the middle stood the
Colonel, very tall and, like all of us, very lean
for lack of diet, for we are all shrunk like persimmons
in December. Before him were seated
the Half-King and the son of Aliquippa, the
Queen of one of the tribes. Last year our
Colonel gave her a red match-coat and a bottle
of rum, and now she is his great friend and
waiting for more favours, especially rum.</p>

<p>The warriors were painted to beat even a
London lady, and no bird has more feathers or
finer. The pipe of Council was passed around,
and all took a few whiffs. When it came to
the turn of our Colonel, he sneezed and
coughed and made a wry face, but none of the
Indians so much as smiled, for they are a very
solemn folk. I could not refrain to laugh, so
hid my face in the last handkerchief I possess.
There are holes in it, too. Then we had the
Indian’s speech and that the Governor sent to
be spoken. After this the Colonel hung around
the necks of the Chiefs medals of silver sent
from England. One had the British lion mauling
the Gallic cock, and on the other side the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
King’s effigy. Then the drums were beat, and
the son of Aliquippa was taken into Council as
a sachem, and given, as is the custom, a new
name. I suppose it is a kind of heathen Christening.
He was called Fairfax. I hope his
Lordship will look after his Godson, or devil
son, as he is more like to be. The Half-King
was made proud with the name of Dinwiddie,
and so we are friends until to-morrow, and
allies—I call them <em>all lies</em>. After this the
Colonel read the morning service, which I hope
pleased them. They believed he was making
magic.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a good account, and I certainly
did make a face with the tobacco-smoke,
for, although at that time I raised the weed,
I cannot endure it.</p>

<p>Captain Mackay arrived on the 7th of
June, but it came about untowardly that
the company which thus joined me was
not Virginian, and gave me more trouble
than help. I may be wrong concerning
the date of Captain Mackay’s arrival, but
he was with us when, on the 10th of June,
I moved out of our fort to prepare the
road for the larger attempt proposed to
take the defences at the Forks of the Ohio.
I soon found that I was to have difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
with this officer. I found him a good sort
of a gentleman, but, as he had a distinct
commission from the King, he declined to
receive my commands, and, I found, would
rather impede the service than forward it.
I have made it a rule, however, to do the
best I can in regard to obstacles I cannot
control, and so I kept my temper and was
always civil to this gentleman, even when
he would not permit his men, unless paid a
shilling a day, to assist in the making of
roads.</p>

<p>As two masters are worse in an army
than anywhere else, he agreed willingly
enough to remain at Fort Necessity, while
I went on toward Redstone Creek with my
Virginians to better my road. It was a
hard task, and at night the men were so
tired that the scouts and sentries could
hardly keep awake. The Indians came in
daily, asking presents, and were mostly
spies.</p>

<p>At Gist’s old camp, thirteen miles from
Great Meadows, I learned that Fort Duquesne
had been reinforced and that I was
to be attacked by a large force. I sent back
for Mackay, and at once called in all my
hunters and scouting-parties. When Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
Mackay arrived we held a council and
resolved that we had a better chance to defend
ourselves at Fort Necessity. The officers
gave up their horses to carry the ammunition,
and we began a retreat with all
possible speed. The weather was of the
worst, very hot and raining, and the Carolina
men, who called themselves king’s soldiers,
would give no assistance in dragging
the swivels. What with hunger and toil,
my rangers were worn out when, on July 1,
we were come back to the fort. I was of
half a mind to push on and secure my retreat
to Wills Creek; but the men refused
to go on with the swivels, and the few
horses we had were mere bone-bags, and
some of them hardly fit to walk.</p>

<p>I turned over the matter that night with
Captains Mackay and Stephen, and resolved,
for, indeed, I could do no better,
to send for help and abide in the fort. I
was well aware that to retreat would turn
every Indian on the frontier against us, and
I was in good hope to hold out.</p>

<p>If, as I wrote the governor, the French
behaved with no greater spirit than they
did in the Jumonville affair, I might yet
come off well enough if provisions reached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
me in time, and I thought with proper reinforcements
we should have no great trouble
in driving them to the devil and
Montreal.</p>

<p>On the evening of July 1 an Indian runner
came in. He had been with De Villiers
and a force from Duquesne. He told me
that when that officer reached Gist’s palisado
he fired on it, but, finding no one there,
was of a mind to go back, thinking I had
returned to the settlements. Unfortunately,
some of our Indians, who were now leaving
us in numbers, told him I meant to make a
stand at Fort Necessity.</p>

<p>Whether I should fall back farther or
not was now a matter for little choice. If
I retreated with tired, half-starved men and
no rum for refreshment, De Villiers’s large,
well-fed force and quick-footed Indians
would surely overtake us, and we should
have to meet superiour numbers without being
intrenched. If Captain Mackay and his
men, in my absence, had done anything to
complete my fort, I should have fared better.
Meanwhile we might be aided with men
from Winchester, or, at least, be provisioned.
I said nothing to the South Carolina
officer of his neglect, for that would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
do no good, and I desired when it came to
fighting he should be in a good humour.</p>

<p>News seemed to fly through the forests as
if the birds carried it, and I was not surprised
to learn before I got to the fort that
the Half-King and nearly all his warriors
had stolen away. He was out of humour
with the officers I had left in charge and
said no one consulted him. I think he desired
to escape a superiour force and to assure
the safety of his squaws and papooses,
whom I was not ill pleased to be rid of, but
not of the warriors.</p>

<p>After my men were fed, Captain Stobo,
Adjutant Muse, Captain Stephen, and I
took off our coats and went to work to help
with axes, Dr. Craik very merry and cheering
the poor fellows, who were worn out
with work.</p>

<p>We raised the log shelter a log higher,
and dug our ditch deeper, and, had we had
more time, had done better to have enlarged
the fort, for it was quite too small for the
force.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVII">XXVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On the evening of July 2, I went over the
place with Captain Stobo. We were in
the middle of a grassy meadow about two
hundred and fifty yards wide, and no wood
nearer than sixty yards. Stobo would have
had us cut down the nearer trees, but the
rangers could work no more. As to men,
I had enough, if I had been supplied with
ammunition and food.</p>

<p>The next day being the 3d, this was tried—I
mean the clearing away of trees; but
about half-past ten I heard a shot in the
woods on that side where the ground rises,
and at once all the men hurried in, as was
beforehand agreed, and a sentry ran limping
out of the woods, wounded. Next came
our scouts in haste to say the French and
Indians, a great force, were a mile away,
eight hundred it was thought. At eleven
I saw them in the forest on the nearest rise
of ground, well under cover. I left Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
Mackay in the fort, and set my rangers in
the ditch, fairly covered by the earth cast
up in the digging of it, hoping the enemy
would make an assault. But they kept in the
woods and fired incessantly. About 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
it came on to rain very heavy, with thunder
and lightning. So great was the downfall
that the water flowing into the ditch half
filled it, and the pans and primings of the
muskets got wetted, and our fire fell off.
Seeing this, I drew the men within the palisadoes
and the log fort, where they were
favourably disposed to resist an attack, for
which the enemy seemed to have no stomach.
This was near about 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and soon,
to my dismay, shots began to fall among us
from the Indians, who climbed the trees and
thus had us at an advantage.</p>

<p>Many men began to drop, and De Peyronney,
a Huguenot captain, was badly
wounded, while our own shooting, because
of the torrent of rain, was much slackened,
and at dusk our ammunition nearly all used.
Twelve men were killed and forty-three
wounded out of the three hundred rangers,
but how many out of the Independent company
I do not know, nor was the loss of the
enemy ever ascertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>About 7 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, seeing that we had almost
ceased to fire, the French called a parley,
which I declined; but at eight, knowing our
state and that we had scarce any provisions
left, I answered their second flag that I
would send an officer, and for this errand
would have ordered De Peyronney, who
spoke the French tongue, but that he was
hurt and in great pain. I had no one but
Van Braam who knew any French. He
went, and returned with demands for a
capitulation so dishonourable that I could
not consider them. At last, however, we
came to terms, which were to march out
with all the honours of war, Van Braam and
Captain Stobo volunteering to go as hostages
for the return of Drouillon and La
Force.</p>

<p>It was eleven o’clock at night and very
dark when Van Braam translated the final
terms of capitulation. We were to march
away unmolested and to agree not to build
forts or occupy the lands of his Most Christian
Majesty for a year; but to this vague
stipulation I did not object. It was raining
furiously, and we heard the terms read by
the light of one candle, which was put out
by the rain, over and over, as Van Braam,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
with no great ease, let me hear what, he
declared, was set down. Unhappily, he
translated the words which twice made me
agree to be taken as the <em>assassin</em> of De Villiers’s
brother, Jumonville, so as to read
that the French had come to revenge the
<em>death</em> of that gentleman, and understanding
it, with Stephen and Mackay, to mean this
and no more, I signed the paper and thus
innocently subjected myself to a foul calumny.</p>

<p>At dawn we moved out with one swivel
and drums beating and colours flying. This
was on July 4. I was reminded of it when,
on July 9, 1776, I paraded the army to announce
that on July 4 the Congress had
declared that we were no longer colonies
but free and independent States. Then I
remembered the humiliation of the morning
when we filed away before those who
were to become our friends and allies.</p>

<p>I bade good-by to Van Braam and Stobo,
and we began our homeward march, all on
foot, because of our horses having been
taken when we were forced to leave them
outside of the fort. We had gone scarce a
mile, carrying our wounded on rude litters,
when, against all the terms agreed upon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the Indians followed and robbed the rear
baggage, misusing many. Upon this, showing
a bold front, I drove them off, and
destroying all useless baggage, set out
again.</p>

<p>Some died on our way, others fell out
and were no more heard of; and thus, half
starved and weary, we made the seventy
miles to Wills Creek.</p>

<p>Having conducted my command to this
point, where was all they required in the
way of clothing and supplies, I rode with
Captain Mackay to Williamsburg.</p>

<p>I felt for a time and with much sharpness
the sense of defeat, and I heard later that
Captain Mackay complained that I was dull
company on the ride, which was no doubt
true enough, for I felt that he and his command
were partly to be blamed.</p>

<p>Indeed, I appeared to myself at this time
the most unfortunate of men; but I have
often been led to observe that we forget our
calamities more easily than the pleasures
of life, nor on the occasion here described
could I so much reproach myself as those
who had failed to supply me with the ammunition
and provisions required for success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>Although it was near to nine at night
when we rode into Williamsburg and put
up at the Raleigh Tavern, I went at once
to the house called the governor’s palace,
but much inferiour in size and convenience
to the fine houses of Westover and Brandon.
The governor being gone to supper
elsewhere, I gave the sealed package containing
the capitulation, all in French, with
the signatures of De Villiers and myself,
to the governor’s aide.</p>

<p>In the morning I called upon the governor
and was cordially received. He said
that we could not go into the details of
the capitulation until the articles of it were
fairly Englished. This would require a
day. He made rather too light, I thought,
of the surrender and of what seemed to
me serious; for to my mind the French
were come to stay.</p>

<p>While the governor was assuring me that
we should easily drive out the invaders,
my kinsman, Colonel Willis of the council,
joined us. He considered the situation on
the frontier as very grave, and succeeded
in alarming the governor, a man of confident
and very sanguine disposition. At
last Colonel Willis turned to me and said:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
“George, I dare venture to engage that this
little fire you have left blazing will set the
world aflame.”</p>

<p>After further talk I left them. I had
been before this in the capital of the colony,
but always for a brief visit. Now, having
time, I walked down the broad Duke of
Gloucester street, and saw the famous
William and Mary College. There were
many fine houses and the handsome parish
church of Bruton, said to have been planned
by the great Sir Christopher Wren.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXVIII">XXVIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The next morning about nine came Mr.
William Fairfax to the inn and said:
“There is some trouble about the capitulations,
but I do not know what. You are
wanted at once by the council.”</p>

<p>Upon this I made haste to reach the palace,
wondering what could be the matter.</p>

<p>In the council-chamber were several gentlemen
standing, in silence—Mr. Speaker
Robinson, Colonel Cary, and my Lord Fairfax,
as I was pleased to see, he having arrived
that morning to be a guest of Governor
Dinwiddie. There were also others,
all standing in groups, but who they were
I fail now to remember. All of them appeared
to be serious as I went in, and there
was, of a sudden, silence, except that the
governor, a bulky man, very red in the face
and of choleric temper, was walking about
cursing in a most unseemly way. Lord
Fairfax alone received me pleasantly, coming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
forward to greet me, but no one else did
more than bow. The governor came toward
me, and holding the capitulations in one
hand, struck them with the other hand and
cried out: “Explain, sir—explain how you,
sir, an officer of the King, came to admit over
your signature that you were an assassin,
and twice, sir, twice. I consider you disgraced.”</p>

<p>Lord Fairfax laid a hand on my arm to
stay me and said:</p>

<p>“Your Excellency, it is not the manner
among us to condemn a man unheard; nor,
sir, to address a gentleman as you have permitted
yourself to do.”</p>

<p>Colonel Cary said: “That, sir, is also my
own opinion.” For this I was grateful,
because on a former occasion he had himself
been lacking in civility.</p>

<p>Then my cousin Willis came across the
room and said very low: “Keep yourself
quiet, George.”</p>

<p>I bowed and asked to be shown the translation.
I read it over with care, while no
one spoke. What had been said was correct.
For a moment I was too amazed to
speak. As I looked up, utterly confounded,
Lord Fairfax said: “Well, colonel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>Upon this I related the facts of the case,
and that Captains Mackay and Stephen had
heard Van Braam translate the articles, and
that he had never used the word <em>assassination</em>,
but, in place of it, <em>death</em>; and that I
considered it to have been ignorance on his
part, and no worse.</p>

<p>I saw also that, while I had been given
to understand by Van Braam that for a
year we were pledged not to make any forts
on the lands of the King of France, I had
really agreed that we were not for that
period to do so beyond the mountains.</p>

<p>When I had thus fully accounted for
my misapprehension, Lord Fairfax said
at once: “Then, gentlemen, this unfortunate
mistake and this unlucky pledge
were due to the governor’s council having
failed to provide Colonel Washington with
a competent French interpreter.” I could
hardly help smiling at this transfer of the
blame to the governor and his advisers.
Colonel Byrd laughed outright, as the governor,
with a great oath, cried out, “Nonsense,
my lord,” and to me, “You should
be broke, sir; you are unfit to command.”</p>

<p>Lord Fairfax said quietly, “Be careful
of your words, governor.” This stayed his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
speech, but amid entire silence he stood
shaking with anger, so that, although his
wig was covered with a net, the powder fell
over his scarlet coat.</p>

<p>Upon this I threw the capitulations on
the table and, with much effort controlling
myself, said: “I have explained myself to
the honourable council and have no more
to say.”</p>

<p>The governor said: “I presume, sir, we
must accept your statement.” I replied at
once, looking about me: “If any gentleman
here doubts it, I—” But on this Colonel
Cary said: “I do not. I think the matter
cleared, Colonel Washington, and I trust
that his Excellency will see that he has
spoken in haste.”</p>

<p>Lord Fairfax and Mr. Robinson also
spoke to like effect, and with a degree of
warmth which set me entirely at ease. The
governor, much vexed to be thus taken to
task, said in a surly way that he was satisfied
and that Van Braam was a traitor,
which I declined to believe, also adding that
Captain Stephen would be asked to see the
governor and confirm my statement.</p>

<p>After this, to my surprise, the governor
desired my company at dinner, and seeing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
Lord Fairfax nod to me, I accepted, but
with no very good will. The matter ended
with a vote of thanks from the House of
Burgesses, Van Braam being left out, and
also Adjutant Muse, who was considered
to have shown cowardice. I was well done
with a sorry business.</p>

<p>Indeed, but for the rain, the bad light,
and that I had no reason to disbelieve what
Van Braam read to us, I should have looked
over the paper, where the word <em>assassin</em>,
being as much English as French, must
have caught my eye. What seemed to me
most strange was that De Villiers should
so easily have let go a man whom he professed
to consider the murderer of his
brother.</p>

<p>When we surrendered the French officers
were very civil, and I saw no evidence of
unusual enmity, but I do not think I met
M. de Villiers.</p>

<p>Van Braam was very much abused and
called a traitor, which I neither then nor
later believed him to have been. Some few
in Virginia blamed me, but since then I
have lived through many worse calumnies.</p>

<p>As each nation was casting the blame of
warlike action on the other, much was made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
in France of the death of De Jumonville
and the surrender of Fort Necessity.</p>

<p>I was able long afterwards to see the account
of this capitulation at Fort Necessity
as it was given by the French commander,
M. de Villiers. It was quite false,
but he could not have known all the facts
as to De Jumonville’s conduct nor how the
Dutchman Van Braam—as I believe, without
intention—misled me. That he was not
bribed to do so is shown by the fact that,
being held as a hostage, he was long kept in
jail in Quebec.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked as worthy of note
that only a month ago I should have heard
news of this old soldier of fortune. A letter
came to me at Mount Vernon in which
Van Braam related his wanderings and how
at last he had settled down in France, as it
would seem, in a prosperous way. He was
very flattering to his old pupil, and, for my
part, I wish him good luck and a better
knowledge of the French tongue than he
had when we starved together at the Great
Meadows.</p>

<p>I am also reminded as I write that Lieutenant-Colonel
Wynne asked leave during
the siege of Yorktown to present to me a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
young French nobleman, an officer of the
regiment Auvergne, whose name now escapes
me. This gentleman’s father had
served in Canada under Marquis Montcalm,
and before that on the frontier. The conversation
fell upon my early service on the
Ohio. To my great astonishment, the
young gentleman told me that in 1759 a
French writer, called, if I remember,
Thomas, published a long piece in verse
about this unfortunate De Jumonville in
America, and how his murder was avenged.
I never supposed any one would write
poetry concerning me, nor do I believe it
will ever happen again.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">I find my diaries insufficient as to the
events which preceded the battle on the
Monongahela, where, in Braddock’s rout,
I lost almost all my papers, with my plans
and maps, chiefly copies of those I had
given the general. This I now regret more
than I did at the time when my memory
served me better. Finding, as I have
noted before, that to write of events recalls
particulars, I shall endeavour thus to revive
my personal remembrances, but not
to record at length the entire history of the
defeat of General Braddock.</p>

<p>I do not suppose that any land was ever
worse governed than Virginia was under
Dinwiddie, and as to military affairs worst
of all, but not worse than other colonies.
The governors were ignorant of warfare
and expected too much from the half-trained
militia and their careless officers.
These conditions may have seemed to justify<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
the King’s order that all officers holding
militia appointments should be outranked
by all royal commissions, and even by the
King’s officers on half-pay. This was bad
enough, but there were also Independent
companies raised in time of need; and their
officers, being directly commissioned by the
governors acting for the King, insisted on
their right to outrank gentlemen of the militia,
and led the men in their commands to
disobey such officers and to consider themselves
of a class superiour to the militia. I
had already had so sad an experience of the
difficulties which arose out of these conditions
that I was unwilling to submit to Governor
Dinwiddie’s plan of making all the
militia Independent companies and with
only captains in command. The object to
be attained by this awkward expedient was
to put a stop to the constant disputes as to
precedency and command. As this would
reduce me from colonel to captain, I made
it clear to the governor that it was not, in
my opinion, a step to be advised, but I
would consider of it, which, indeed, took me
no long time.</p>

<p>In November I resigned my commission,
and before it was accepted went to Alexandria,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
where my regiment then lay. I asked
the officers to meet me and explained the
cause of my being forced to resign. I was
surprised to find that my resolution, which
all admitted to be reasonable, met with the
most flattering opposition. Indeed, I received
soon after a letter from these gentlemen
in which, with much more, they said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We, your obedient and affectionate officers,
beg leave to express our great concern at the
marked disagreeable news we have received of
your determination to resign the command of
the corps. Your steady adherence to impartial
justice, your quick discernment and invariable
regard to merit, enlivened our natural emulation
to excel.</p>
</div>

<p>As this letter lies before me and I think
of the emotion it caused me, I still like to
remember that at the close they spoke of
me as “one who taught them to despise
danger and to think lightly of toil and hardships
while led by a man they knew and
loved.”</p>

<p>I have been spoken of as wanting in sensibility.
If it had been said I lacked means
to show what I feel, that were to put the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
matter more correctly. Even now the recollection
of the praise thus given moves me
deeply, and recalls the memory of my farewell
to those who served with me in the
War of Independency. I was but twenty-three
when I left the colonial service.</p>

<p>I did so with much reluctance, for my
desire was not to leave the military line, as
my inclinations were still strongly bent to
arms, and of this I assured Colonel Fitzhugh
very plainly when he would have had
me submit to return to service in the inferiour
grade of captain. I preferred my
farm to submitting to this degradation.</p>

<p>Among the minor matters which, by degrees,
discontented even the most loyal of
the upper class of Virginia gentlemen,
none was more ill borne than the impertinence
and insults to which this order of the
King gave rise.</p>

<p>Having thus, with much regret, resigned
my commission, I retired to private life at
Mount Vernon and to the care of my neglected
plantations.</p>

<p>As we had left two hostages, Van Braam
and Stobo, in the hands of the French after
my defeat at the Meadows, I was anxious
that La Force and the French officers we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
held should be treated with decency and exchanged
for my two captains.</p>

<p>In spite of my earnest remonstrances,
Drouillon and two cadets were alone offered
for exchange, and La Force held in
prison, which, of course, the French refused
to consider. My wishes were disregarded
in this matter in which I considered
my honour was involved, and I was treated
with the indifference the governor so often
showed to the advice of colonial gentlemen
of consideration. I was deeply mortified,
and La Force was at least two years in
jail, nor do I know what became of him.
In retaliation, Van Braam and Stobo were
long detained in prison by the French at
Quebec, but finally got away, I do not know
how. Captain Stobo, a Scotchman, I believe,
was a sober, brave, and sensible man.
That he was ingenious and little subject to
fear appears from the fact that, while imprisoned
at Fort Duquesne, he contrived a
plan of the fort, and also to send it to the
governor by an Indian. Had he been detected
it must have cost his life.</p>

<p>After the fall of Quebec in 1759, I was informed
by an officer that Captain Stobo
made his escape before that event, and had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
been able to join his Majesty’s troops, and
finally had guided General Wolfe on the
path by which he succeeded to occupy the
Plains of Abraham. I do not know what
truth there was in the story.</p>

<p>While time ran on and I was busy with
the innocent pursuits of agriculture, England
and France were preparing for serious
warfare, and as I heard of the efforts to be
made to recover the Ohio and the forts at
the North, I became troubled that I was
to have no share in the business. Sir John
St. Clair had come out in this year (1755)
as deputy quartermaster-general, and was
at once much disgusted at colonial inefficiency,
and expressed himself with such
freedom as gave great offence. Five weeks
later, in February, I believe, General Braddock
reached Williamsburg, where I then
chanced to be on business concerning the
purchase of bills on London. On this occasion
I once more appealed to the authorities
concerning Stobo and Van Braam; but
although I spent some time in efforts to
persuade Governor Dinwiddie that to further
hold La Force was to prevent the
release of two brave and innocent men,
he persistently refused. Upon this I went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
away, declining to discuss other matters on
which he would have had my opinion.</p>

<p>While at Williamsburg, Colonel Peyton
invited me to visit Sir John St. Clair, to
whom I was able to express my regret that
the conditions of the King’s late order as
to rank must deprive me and other colonial
gentlemen of the pleasure of serving. Sir
John said that he was surprised to encounter
so much sensitiveness among us.
To this I made no reply, but Colonel Byrd,
who was present, said if Sir John would in
his mind reverse our positions he would find
the matter to explain itself. Sir John said
that he could not imagine himself a provincial
captain of border farm-hands.</p>

<p>Upon this Colonel Byrd rose and said
there was also something which he could
not imagine Sir John to be. Seeing a quarrel
close at hand, a thing very undesirable
when already we were on edge owing to
the affectation of superiority on the part
of some of Sir John’s aides, I was fortunate
enough to say that Colonel Byrd no
doubt misunderstood Sir John, and that I
never had been able to put myself in another
man’s place. Sir John, who had
spoken hastily, was also of no mind to provoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
a gentleman of Colonel Byrd’s influence,
and said at once that he had no
intention to offend, and thus the matter
ended.</p>

<p>It was, however, this kind of thing which
made so much bad blood in the colonies
and was so deeply resented by men of all
classes.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I met Colonel Byrd,
who said I had spoiled a good quarrel and
that he considered it would be necessary
to teach some of the officers a lesson in
manners. I said I hoped that at this crisis
it might be avoided. I had quite forgot
this incident, and am agreeably surprised,
now that my memory is failing, at recovering
by attention so many things which
seemed lost.</p>

<p>On the following morning Sir John called
upon me and asked would I dine with him
that day, to meet General Braddock, whom,
on his arrival, I had welcomed in a letter
expressing my regret at being out of the
service.</p>

<p>I was glad to meet the new commander,
and at Sir John’s request named several
gentlemen who should have the same honour,
and who might be of great use in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
campaign. On this occasion there was less
heavy drinking than usual, and I was very
agreeably entertained and much questioned
as to the border. I promised to send
my maps to the general, who, upon my
taking leave, hoped some way might be
found to secure my services in the coming
campaign.</p>

<p>Indeed, I was more eager than the general,
and, as occasion served, I was still
more open with some of the younger members
of General Braddock’s family concerning
my continued desire to follow the military
line.</p>

<p>I rode homeward a day or two later,
taking Fredericksburg on the way, that I
might see my mother. I found her in the
garden of her house, engaged in putting
some plants in the ground.</p>

<p>She said she was pleased to see me, but
did hardly look up from her work and went
on talking of the family. I was of no mind
to stop her, and, indeed, it was always best
to let her have her say; nor did I now interrupt
her, which out of respect I never
inclined to do.</p>

<p>My sister Betty Lewis, having more desire
to talk than I ever had, could never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
hear my mother out, and this I did not approve,
nor did it do any good.</p>

<p>While I was listening came a servant
with a letter inclosed in a cover with a
flying seal of Captain Orme’s arms. The
letter within carried the royal arms and
“On his Majesty’s service with speed,”
wrote large. It appeared that when I had
gone, the general’s aide, Captain Orme, requested
Colonel Peyton to forward to me
this communication, and accordingly he had
sent it after me as desired. I excused myself
and read it with pleasure.</p>

<p>My mother, being curious as to small
things, and as to large ones too often indifferent,
asked me what it was, and was
eager to know why it bore the King’s arms.
I saw no better way than to let her read it.</p>

<p>She gave it back to me, saying, “I suppose
my opinions about this business of
war are never to be regarded,” and more besides
than I desire to recall. I replied that
there was only one answer a man of honour
and a loyal subject of the King could
make, and that I should at once accept if
time were given me to set in order my affairs;
and so, with this, after much advice
on her part that my duty lay at home and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
on my plantation, I got away, avoiding to
say more, my mind being fully made up.
I find the letter now among my papers, and
reading it in my old age, renew the memory
of the satisfaction it gave me when young.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><i>Williamsburg, March 2, 1755.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The General, having been informed by
friends that you expressed some desire to make
the campaign, but that you declined it upon
some disagreeableness that you thought might
arise from the regulations of command, has ordered
me to acquaint you that he will be very
glad of your company in his family, by which
all inconveniences of that kind will be obviated.</p>

<p>I shall think myself very happy to form an
acquaintance with a person so universally
esteemed, and shall use every opportunity of
assuring you how much I am</p>

<p class="noic">Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="padr2"><i>Robert Orme</i>,</p>

<p class="right">Aide-de-camp.</p>
</div>

<p>I have no doubt that Colonel Peyton was
the gentleman who, knowing my wishes,
had suggested my appointment. I was considered
by some to have been imprudent at
Fort Necessity, and the governor, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
of the freedom of speech I used with him
in the matter of Stobo and La Force, had
for me no great regard, and was very unlikely
to have favoured me with the general.</p>

<p>Before leaving Williamsburg, Mr. C——,
a cousin of Colonel Peyton, visited me and
said he had been well advised to seek my
friendship in a letter from the colonel,
which he thought might please me and
which I was free to read. As to my appearance,
wit, and judgment, the letter
spoke in the most agreeable language, and
added that I was destined to make no
inconsiderable figure in our country. I
confess to having felt, as I read it, both
pleasure and doubt.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXX">XXX</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">I had thus engaged as a volunteer, much
against the wishes of my mother, who,
as she said, saw no good in war and entreated
me not again to expose myself to
peril in the wilderness. If the French had
been of her opinion as to war, I might have
stayed at home. We had an unpleasant
meeting, or rather parting, for she did little
else but lament; but what was there I could
do? I left her in tears.</p>

<p>I have no intention to record here the
full history of this expedition, but rather to
revive for my own interest what I, personally,
saw, and what is nowhere else fully
set down.</p>

<p>My appointment gave satisfaction to
many friends, who felt more deeply than I
myself that in the matter of commissions
and as to the Villiers affair—for that was
soon noised about—I had been ill treated
by the governor. The favourable sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
thus expressed could not, under the
circumstances, be other than pleasing to a
mind which had always walked a straight
line and endeavoured, as far as human
frankness and strong passions would allow,
to discharge the relative duties to his Maker
and to his fellow-countrymen without by
indirect means seeking popularity.</p>

<p>As I pause here before making the effort
to recall some of the incidents of the disastrous
events in which I was to have a
share, I remember with pleasure the friends
who felt that my honourable invitation from
a veteran general was a final answer to the
censures of the King’s governor.</p>

<p>Nor, in looking back over the greater
war and my life in office, have I had reason
to complain of want of affection from those
whose esteem I desired to retain. Many
times in my life I have, however, had just
cause to complain of things said of me by
those who possessed my regard, but I have
in all such cases felt it better not to sacrifice
a friendship on account of ill temper
or the indiscretion of the hour, and am
made happy in the belief that I have thus
been able to keep what I would not willingly
have lost. Where men have been needed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
the service or in office, I have been still more
desirous of forgiving words or actions
which affected me alone, but which did not
in the end destroy their usefulness. Nor
have I myself been without need to be thus
considered, for at times I am by nature irritable
and short of temper. Lawrence
once said to me that he found it more easy
to forgive his enemies than his friends; but
this I did not clearly see, and, after all, if a
man is resolved to keep himself from thinking
of what is said against him, the memory
of it soon becomes dulled and there is
less need of forgiveness.</p>

<p>Among the many evidences of esteem I
had before the Braddock affair was a letter
from Captain Peyronney, now recovered
of his wound, but to die bravely on the
Monongahela. He must have heard that
I had been ill spoken of by Major Muse and
perhaps by others. He wrote very odd
English, but I could hardly find fault with
his meaning.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Le Chevalier de Peyronney</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>I had much cause to feel grateful for
such friends, and I may here add that, as
concerns Van Braam, I had his censure reversed
when I myself became a member of
the House of Burgesses.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after bringing my
affairs into order, I set out, determined to
lose no chance to perfect my military education.</p>

<p>At Fredericktown I met the general, and
on May 10 was announced in general orders
as aide, with brevet rank of captain. I
rode thence in advance to Winchester,
where I had need to send a servant to borrow
fresh horses from my friend Lord Fairfax,
who himself came later from Greenway
Court to meet me and rode with me about
one hundred miles to Wills Creek, near to
which was Fort Cumberland, so named for
the captain-general.</p>

<p>On the last day of our ride, as we rode on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
over, I do believe, the most abominable
roads in the world, I described to his lordship
the array of well-drilled men, sailors,
artillery, etc., I had seen at Alexandria,
landed from Admiral Keppel’s fleet, and
said, if I remember, that it was a great advantage
to serve under a gentleman of General
Braddock’s abilities and experience,
and that as to any danger from the enemy, I
considered it as trifling, for I believed the
French would be obliged to exert their utmost
strength to repel the attacks about to
be made on their forts at Niagara and
Crown Point.</p>

<p class="cap">As I talked, Lord Fairfax, who had seen
greater armies, heard me in silence,
and indeed, when I ceased, remained for a
time without making any comment. Then
he reined up his horse, and, handing me
two letters, said: “I have kept these for
your private reading, George; I have them
through the kindness of one of Admiral
Keppel’s officers.” I read them as we rode
on, well in the rear, to avoid the annoyance
caused by the marching of the Forty-eighth
Foot, which beat up a great dust. He said:
“Read them again at your leisure.” I did
as was desired, and, as they happened to be
left in my buckskin-coat pocket and forgot,
they were the only papers I chanced to save
in the battle. They are now before me, and
I read them anew with interest. Not for
many years have I seen them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>: I take this occasion to write
you. London is very gay, and the clubs and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
their wits amazing merry over the appointment
of Edward Braddock to command the force sent
out to protect you from the Indians. Ch. S——y
was here for dinner yesterday. He said General
B. was a stranger both to fear and common sense,
and that his best fitness to fight Indians was that
he was providentially bald. Lord C. S. says he
saw Anne Bellamy, the actress, whom the General
visited when on the point of leaving London.
She said Mr. Braddock was melancholy, and declared
he was sent with a handful of men to
conquer nations and to cut his way through an
unknown wilderness.</p>

<p>He said: “We are sent like sacrifices to the
altar.” That ancient ram! say I. He told her
she would never see him again.</p>

<p>I wish you luck of your new General. He is
touchy, punctilious, of a stiff mind, and has had
forty years in the Guards. I do not think he was
eager to leave Anne Bellamy and the clubs, for
the man is a favourite; but he has little money,
and it will be at least agreeable to spend the
king’s guineas.</p>

<p>If you were a woman I should tell you the new
fashions. The beaux now carry their watches
in their muffs, and the women are taking, more
and more, to what Charles S——y calls undress
uniform, so that soon Madame Eve will be the
fashionable maker of gowns!—but I must not
nourish your provincial blushes. Lord R. tells
me that your General is a sad brute, for when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
his sister—a pretty thing she was—spent all her
money at cards and hanged herself, the man
said: “Poor Fanny, I always thought she would
play till she would be forced to tuck herself up.”
Horace Walpole says, when she meant to die,
she wrote with a diamond on the window-pane
this out of Garth’s “Dispensary”:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To die is landing on some silent shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Where billows never break nor tempests roar.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But why should the woman die when she had
a diamond left to gamble with?</p>

<p>However, the Duke of Cumberland is his patron,
and that is enough. F——x lost the other
night at White’s, they say, £1000 and—</p>
</div>

<p>I looked up and said: “The rest does not
seem to be of interest or to say more of the
general.”</p>

<p>“No, but always look at the postscript of
a lady’s letter. There is more about your
general.”</p>

<p>It was true, for I read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>P. S. I meant not to tell you of Braddock’s
affair with Colonel Gumley, who was his friend,
but I may as well, even if you think it incredible.
A letter is a fine way to talk, because you
can never see the blush you may cause, and may
fib without being vexed by contradiction until
so long after that you have forgotten all about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
it. But what a pother I am making about my
harmless gossip!</p>

<p>When Braddock quarrelled over cards with
his friend, and swords were drawn, Gumley
(you know, Lord Pulteney married his sister)
cried out: “Braddock, you are a penniless dog.
If you kill me you have no money, and you will
have to run away.” So with that he tossed him
his purse. Braddock was in such a rage that
Gumley easily disarmed him, but he would not
ask his life.</p>
</div>

<p>As we rode on I said it seemed to me to
show that our general was foolishly obstinate,
and that I liked the other man better,
but neither very much.</p>

<p>His lordship said: “Yes, yes; it is a wild
and a silly life. The woman is heartless,
but what she says may serve to put you on
your guard. These people think London
the only part of the world worth a thought.
The other letter is of more moment. It is
from Colonel Conway. I have inked over
these names; they do not matter. He is of
another clay.”</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="right"><i>London.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Lord</span>: My nephew, Mr. Henry
Wilton, carries this letter to you, and any kind
attention you may feel disposed to pay him will
oblige me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>I think the choice of Braddock unfortunate.
He is a brave, or rather a reckless, man, overconfident,
arrogant, and sure to despise his enemy,
and goes out, as I am assured, with a bad
opinion of the Colonials. Horace Walpole, who
knows, as we all do, the mad life Braddock has
led in London, says: “He is a very Iroquois in
disposition, and so, I suppose, fit to fight his
kind.” Horace is making himself merry over
the appointment, and the Colonial helping he is
to have. But it is the fashion here to laugh at
Colonials, and not for the world would Horace
be out of the fashion. I wish the General may
have good fortune, but I fear the matching of
drill and pipe-clay against the wiles of the
woods; as sensible would it be to set a fencing-master
with a rapier to fight a tiger in a jungle.
When I consider how vast is this increasing number
of English in a country where must be great
prospects and a fine sense of independency, I
wonder how little they are regarded here. But
it is our way to despise other nations, and even
our own blood if it has had enterprise to cross
the seas. Come back and help us to learn better.</p>

<p>His lordship looked at me as I put away
the letters. I said: “That seems to me good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
sense; but about the general, I cannot credit
it.”</p>

<p>“You will judge for yourself,” he said,
“if this be the man to send into the wilderness.
Keep the letters, but do not lose
them; you may return them later.” Which
I should have done, only that the rout on
the Monongahela put it out of my mind.</p>

<p class="cap">It was about noon when, as I have said,
being in the rear of the Forty-eighth
Foot, we heard a noise behind us. We drew
up at the side within the wood to see what
was coming.</p>

<p>Amid a great dust came General Braddock,
in a fine red chariot bought of Governor
Sharpe, with an escort of light horse,
all in great haste, and bumping over the
worst road possible. Presently they flew
by the troops, who saluted, the drums beating
the Grenadier’s March, a tune I was to
hear again.</p>

<p>“If I were the general,” I said, “I should
have preferred a horse to a coach.”</p>

<p>“Not if you were he,” said his lordship.</p>

<p>“But the man is not a fool,” I ventured
to say. “He seemed to me not to want for
intelligence.”</p>

<p>“An intelligent fool, George, is the worst
fool. His intelligence feeds his folly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>This, like much else that his lordship said
to me, was not so plain as it would be now,
and, accordingly, I made no reply.</p>

<p>After being silent for a time, his lordship
went on to say that I should do well to talk
little, and quietly to observe things for myself;
that he himself knew General Braddock
to be a spendthrift, obstinate as a pig,
and very self-confident; and, finally, that I
knew what a lot of drilled regulars would
be worth in the woods. He feared also that
the officers were quite unfit for the service.</p>

<p>As it was the way of his lordship to mock
at most things, it did not affect me as much
as what I saw and heard later, for, unfortunately,
he was not alone in his opinion
concerning the general.</p>

<p>By and by, the general having preceded
us by an hour, we heard the salute of seventeen
guns, fired as he entered the camp.</p>

<p>We came in sight of the tents about Wills
Creek early in the afternoon, and were
walking our horses, very tired, man and
beast, when a gentleman came towards us.
He was mounted on a rather uneasy animal,
and I saw, as he met us and we bowed, that
his girth was loose and he in danger of a
fall. I dismounted and, with an apology,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
set it right. He thanked me and got off
his horse, saying, as was plain to see, that
he was no horseman and would walk, preferring
two certain legs to four uncertain
ones. On this his lordship also dismounted,
and, our servants taking the horses, we
walked on together. But first his lordship
said: “I am Lord Fairfax, and this is
my friend, Colonel George Washington.
May we have the honour to know your
name?”</p>

<p>He replied, “I am Benjamin Franklin,”
and asked if this were Colonel Washington
who had been in command in the Jumonville
affair. I said I had had that good
fortune, and after this he turned to his lordship,
and, they conversing, I was able to observe
the looks and ways of Mr. Franklin,
who was now the Postmaster-General and
known throughout the colonies as a learned
man, and in affairs very competent. I was
to be deeply engaged with him in the future.</p>

<p>He was at this time a vigorous man of
forty-nine years, with a great head and a
kindly look, clad very simply in a gray suit.
When he began to talk I envied him the
ease and exactness with which he expressed
himself, and the prudence he showed in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
speech, of which quality his lordship had
little.</p>

<p>When at last the Postmaster-General
learned that I was to serve as a volunteer
aide, he smiled and remarked that that was
to manufacture glory for others and not
even to get pay. To this I replied that I considered
my ends were clear enough to me,
for that I was, as it were, an apprentice,
and was bent to acquire experience in war
under one who knew the business. He said
he hoped I should not be disappointed, and
at this I saw his lordship smile; and so no
more of moment passed between us, for we
met Captain Orme and Sir John St. Clair,
and were soon in the camp.</p>

<p>Here was our most western fort. It lay
very well, what there was of it finished,
just where Wills Creek falls into the Potomac.</p>

<p>I went, with Captain Orme guiding me,
to headquarters at the fort to report, passing
a few Indians and squads of ill-clad Virginians
whom an officer, one Ensign Allen,
was cursing and trying to drill into regulars.</p>

<p>Everybody was out of temper for one
reason or another. Sir John could get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
neither waggons nor flour, and the Indian
squaws were making mischief because of the
unchecked license of the younger officers.</p>

<p>Having reported, I was received very
agreeably by the general and his aides, and
he would have me to dine with him that
day. At four in the afternoon—for the
general kept very fashionable hours—we
sat down in a great room in the fort, and
as he told us his cooks could make a good
ragout out of old boots, we were served
with a great variety of dishes, and in fine
state.</p>

<p>The general had Lord Fairfax on his
right and Mr. Franklin on his left, and I
was fortunate to find myself beside a very
courteous gentleman just come to the fort,
Mr. Richard Peters, secretary of Governor
Morris of Pennsylvania. I engaged this
gentleman in talk concerning the proprietary
government and the Quakers, and
their unwillingness to be taxed for defence,
until, the wine being freely used and then
punch more than enough, men’s tongues
were loosed. There were toasts to the King
and the governor, and at last I heard the
general’s voice raised.</p>

<p>He said: “Your health, Mr. Peters, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
when do you set out to cut that road for my
troops? You are long about it.” Mr.
Peters said quietly: “When, sir, I get
guards against the Indians for the wood-cutters;
until then it will not be possible.”</p>

<p>The general damned Pennsylvania and
the Quakers, and said: “That colony must
find guards for their own wood-cutters, and
as to the Indians, his Majesty’s regulars
laugh at the idea of danger from them.”
Upon which, several officers, not very sober,
cried out, “Hear, hear!”</p>

<p>Mr. Peters, who had taken very little
wine, replied that they were not to be despised,
meaning the savages, but that every
step of the march would be at risk of ambuscades.</p>

<p>Then, to my amazement, General Braddock
cried out that he despised such counsels
and that the colonials were like old
women.</p>

<p>On this Mr. Peters rose, and one or two
other gentlemen, and I saw Mr. Franklin
glance at him. As he hesitated, I said so
that he alone could hear: “Pardon me, Mr.
Peters, the man is drunk, and you are entirely
right.” Then I saw that his lordship
spoke quickly to the general, who cried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
out: “My apologies, Mr. Peters, and a
glass with you. We have had too many
vinous counsellors. You shall have your
guards”—as indeed he did, but not until
my lord had been very urgent, and also Mr.
Franklin. Mr. Peters, very grave, bowed
and sat down. When shortly his lordship
went away, I made my own excuses and followed
him.</p>

<p>The next day I happened to be in his lordship’s
quarters and Mr. Franklin present,
when General Braddock called to pay his
respects to Lord Fairfax. We rose to go
out, but his lordship detained us. The general
was in high spirits. He said to Mr.
Franklin: “Only let the colonies keep their
promise and all will be well.”</p>

<p>I confess I was unprepared for the confidence
with which he assured Mr. Franklin
that he would take Duquesne and go on
to Niagara and Frontenac, and that the fort
would be an affair of a day or two.</p>

<p>“But, sir,” said Mr. Franklin, “you must
march through a narrow road in pathless,
dense forests, and your line will be some
four miles long. You will, I hope, take
Duquesne, but you will be, I fear, in constant
danger of being cut in two, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
French and Indians are dexterous in ambuscades,
and to send back relief quickly,
if attacked, will be nigh to impossible with
woods all about you. As to the waggons
we talked of, I will get you all the waggons
you want out of Pennsylvania, and shall set
out for Lancaster at once.”</p>

<p>The general thanked him, but said he
must remind Mr. Franklin that he talked
as a civilian, and that, although these savages
might be formidable to raw American
militia, they would make no impression on
disciplined troops, and much more to like
effect.</p>

<p>Mr. Franklin replied quietly: “I am conscious,
sir, of the impropriety of arguing
such matters with a military man, but I
should like to ask Colonel Washington his
opinion. He has had some experience in
the irregular warfare of our woods.”</p>

<p>His lordship, desirous, as I learned later,
that I should not contradict my superiour,
said: “I beg to answer for Mr. Washington
that I am sure General Braddock will, as
time serves, consult such colonial officers as
have seen service on the frontier.”</p>

<p>After other talk the general rose, and
said he should be sure to take his lordship’s
advice.</p>

<p class="cap">When alone with us the Postmaster-General
talked with even greater
seriousness, saying that in Philadelphia, so
secure were they of the success of the campaign,
that a gentleman, a Dr. Bond I think
it was, proposed to raise money for an illumination
to be ready when the news of victory
came. Mr. Franklin told us that he had
begged him to take warning from a verse
in the Old Testament as to before battle and
after, and this much pleased his lordship,
who laughed and said, “Well put, sir”;
but when I asked what the verse was, they
both laughed and bade me read my Bible,
and, indeed, I am none the wiser up to this
day.</p>

<p>It was not alone the general who was discontented.
On arriving at Wills Creek I
found this letter from George Croghan, one
of the most important traders on the frontier,
and with a commission from Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
to make roads and secure waggons
and Indian allies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Colonel</span>: If the rest are like Sir John
St. Clair, I shall be glad to be shut of the business.
He swore at us for delay and said “no
soldier should handle an axe, but by fire and
sword he would force the inhabitants to do the
work; we should be treated as traitors, and that
when the General came he would give us ten bad
words for one that he had given.” You, Sir,
know well how hard it is to stir up our border
folks and what a task to get from farmers in the
spring their waggons and horses. We are doing
our best. I have secured Captain Jack—a guide
hard to beat.</p>
</div>

<p>There was more of it, and enough to afford
serious thought.</p>

<p>During our stay I heard nothing but complaints
of our want of efficiency, and no
one seemed to see that it was silly to expect
to find everything at hand in a land as
new as ours. Captain Orme and Ensign
Allen complained on one occasion to Dr.
Mercer and me that our men were languid,
spiritless, and unsoldier-like. Dr. Mercer,
who was a hot-headed Scotchman, said he
had seen undisciplined Highlanders put to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
rout regulars at Prestonpans and Falkirk,
and that in the woods our men would beat
the best grenadiers in the King’s army.
Orme grew angry and said Mercer was a
damned rebel; but I succeeded in quieting
them, although I insisted that Captain Orme
would in time change his opinion, as indeed
happened. Mercer was in a constant rage
and told me over and over that the officers
were insolent and that the general was ill
with the disease called damned foolishness.
I thought him imprudent and begged him
to be careful; but as he had served in ’45
with the Pretender, and come over here
after his flight, he was, on that account, in
bad odour with the regular officers, and, I
feared, also with the general, who had been
with the Duke of Cumberland upon the final
bloody defeat of the rebels at Culloden. Dr.
Mercer had just cause to complain, but I
thought him unwise to talk so freely. He
was, nevertheless, a gallant gentleman, and
died a general, falling gloriously at Princeton
when rallying his men.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Franklin again but once before
he went away. He was clearly not a man altogether
to the liking of Lord Fairfax, but
why, I never came to know. He seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
me at that time a conscientious and intelligent
person, very able to get along with all
manner of people. I must admit that he
conducted matters of gravity as if they
amused him and were not serious, a method
which never altogether pleased me. When
I justified the general’s groaning over his
many difficulties as to roads and transport
and food, he said that his difficulties were
of British making, and that had the force
landed in Philadelphia, horses, waggons,
and supplies would have been found in
abundance. To this I agreed, for I thought
the plan of the march ill chosen. After this
the doctor amused himself with the astonishment
the Indians would have when they
got hold of the wigs of the officers—a jest
which did not seem to me agreeable. He
spoke also with much freedom of the general,
and said to argue with him was useless
and was like striking a pillow or reasoning
with a wild animal, who had only its own
thoughts and could not comprehend yours.
I made no reply, and he fell to most ingenious
talk about the temperature of
springs and the ways of swimming. Notwithstanding
his doubts, the great array of
war kept me somewhat confident and cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
until I heard that nine hundred men of
the French had passed Sandusky on their
way to reinforce the French on the Ohio,
so that I had to write Mr. Speaker Robinson
that I feared we should have more to
do than merely to march up and down the
hills, as the general had said would be all.</p>

<p>It was May 19 when the general arrived
at Fort Cumberland, and June 10 before
he set out to cross the mountains, and after,
as the general said, more expenditure of
oaths in a month than he had needed in his
whole Scotch campaign with the duke, of
whom the general liked to speak.</p>

<p>I spent much of my time while we lay at
this post in learning the methods of drill
and discipline, and in aiding to satisfy the
Virginia recruits that it was necessary to
imitate the methods of the regulars, although
if it came to wood fighting I believed
the English officers and men would more
need to learn the ways of the rangers. Yet
some who judged our people by their dislike
of strict drill were of opinion that the
lowness and ignorance of their officers gave
little hope of their future behaviour under
fire. My task of helping to train the men
was given up when the general ordered me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
to go to Williamsburg and fetch back four
thousand pounds, an errand not much to
my liking.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the detail was made without
my having the opportunity of choice,
and proved very unfit, giving me much concern
and anxiety. I do not know why there
was delay in assembling this detail, but
eight days passed after I got my order before
I was given the men. I believe they
would not have been eight seconds in dispersing
if we had been attacked.</p>

<p>Captain Horatio Gates, of a New York
Independent company, advised not to take
regulars, who would obey only their own
officers; but I had no choice, and so set out
and was gone a fortnight. On my return
I slept every night in the waggon, with my
precious money about me and pistols loaded.
The men were drunken and disobedient until
I promised strappado on our reaching
camp, and indeed I was glad to be rid of
the money and the guard.</p>

<p>I saw during this ride and later that, as
Orme had told me, the men of the Forty-fourth
and Forty-eighth regiments were
drunken, mutinous, and disorderly, so that
it was not alone our own failures to provide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
which made difficult the task of our unfortunate
commander.</p>

<p>I found the general much disgusted at
the delays in supplying him, and, as I
thought, most unwise, and only increased
his trouble by abuse of the colonies, for the
more men deserve abuse the less they like it,
and get sullen and less than ever inclined to
help.</p>

<p>Just before we set out from Fort Cumberland,
the general being now in the saddle,
Lord Fairfax presented me with a handsome
pair of pistols, and said: “I should
have been pleased to have had a son like
you; but for that I must have had a wife,
which is a calamity I have been spared. If
occasion serves, I shall be glad to hear from
you.”</p>

<p>Lord Fairfax had informed me that General
Braddock would ask my opinion and
advice as to the use to be made of Indians
and our rangers. He did consult me, but
only, I believed, because his lordship had
desired him to do so.</p>

<p>I never succeeded to make much impression
upon him, and it was as the wise Mr.
Franklin had said. Many Indians joined
us on the way with their squaws, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
chiefs were too little considered or consulted.
Their women were insulted or
worse, and those that came to-day, receiving
no gifts, were gone to-morrow.</p>

<p>On June 6, Sir John St. Clair was sent
on in advance with some six hundred choppers
to widen and better my old road.
After him came Sir Peter Halket’s force.
On June 10, if I remember aright, the general
followed with his staff and the rest of
the army. As soon as the march began, the
lack of discipline became plain, and the
officers were worse than the men and altogether
too much drunkenness.</p>

<p>Captain Croghan said to me: “I should
like to give these fellows a wood drill and
upset half the rum-kegs.” This was as we
led our horses over the second mountain.
“Why, sir,” he said, “here are hundreds
of waggons and enough gimcracks and nonsense
to fit out a town, and all the officers of
foot on horseback.”</p>

<p>I said that I had represented to the general
and Colonel Dunbar the risk of this
long train, and urged that we use our horses
for packhorses and to carry only what we
really needed. “That would be,” Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
Croghan said, “for the men, blankets, an
axe, a rifle, a knife, and ammunition.”</p>

<p>He went on to tell us that he had urged
this to be done again and again—that was,
to Captains Orme and Shirley, the military
secretary of the commander, for he had been
told plainly enough that he was himself too
small a person to converse with the general,
and a d—d trader he had been called. He
was sure the general would listen to no advice
except from the King’s officers. I had
to admit that he listened to me at times, and
had always said in a civil way that he would
consider of what I advised, but got no further.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXIV">XXXIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Croghan came to me the day after at
my hut (I am not sure of this date),
and with him was Mr. Gist and a tall man
in buckskins, leggins, and moccasins. He
carried a long rifle and a scalping-knife.</p>

<p>Captain Croghan said: “This, colonel, is
my friend, Captain Jack, of whom I wrote.
He has come with fifty Pennsylvania men
to offer as scouts.”</p>

<p>I had heard often of this man and was
pleased that we were to have his services.
I made him welcome, bade him be seated,
and offered him rum, which he refused to
take, saying he drank no spirits. He was
very silent and made brief answers to my
questions concerning the Indians and their
inclinations. When I would have gone further,
he rose and said his men were waiting
to camp. He must see the general, and
asked me to go with him. As we walked
through the shelters the rangers had set up,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
I saw many look at him with curiosity,
which was not surprising, for he was not
less than six feet three, but a gaunt, thin
man, of melancholic aspect. He never spoke
a word, but presently we met a certain
Major Moore, a rough, hard-drinking officer
of the grenadiers. As he stopped us,
I saw that he was under liquor, as was too
common. He said, “Whom have you got
there? Make a fine grenadier.” I said,
“This is Captain Jack, a famous Pennsylvania
scout,” and so would have passed on,
when the major said rudely to Captain Jack,
“Who the deuce made you a captain?”
The scout tapped his rifle and said, “That,”
and walked on, without saying more than
his gesture seemed to imply. I could not
avoid remarking, “You are well answered,
major,” for I have always had a liking for
men who do not talk much. I contented myself
with saying to the scout that, as usual,
the major was in liquor.</p>

<p>I sent in my name to General Braddock,
and we were desired to enter his tent. Here
I introduced Captain Jack as an experienced
ranger and said he had fifty good
scouts. The general asked me to be seated,
but as he did not invite the scout to sit down,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
I remained standing. As for the captain,
he said not so much as a word, but waited,
looking steadily at the general, who asked
me a question concerning the roads, and
then said to me, “Let the man wait; I will
see about him in a day or two.” Then he
asked what pay they wanted, to which Captain
Jack said, “No pay, nothing.”</p>

<p>I tried to make the general understand
the great service we might expect in the
woods from such men, but he replied impatiently
that these men could not be drilled,
and that he had experienced troopers on
whom he could rely for any service he
might require. He was going on to give
orders as to where the men should camp,
when Captain Jack turned and went out
without further words. The general
damned him roundly for an ill-bred cur, and
I made after him in haste. When I had
overtaken him, he said very quietly: “Good-by,
Colonel Washington; when you have a
separate command send for me.” I made
a vain effort to induce him to remain. In
half an hour he called his men together, and
they went away into the woods Indian
fashion, one after the other, and we saw
him no more. Captain Croghan told me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
that this man had had his whole family
massacred by the Indians, and had spent
years in revenging himself, sometimes
alone, and sometimes with a party, for he
was both esteemed and trusted on the border-lands
of Pennsylvania. Both Croghan
and I were much disappointed.</p>

<p>Amid the difficulties caused by European
need of useless luxuries and by the absence
in officers and men of what Mr. Franklin
called “pliability in the hands of new circumstances,”
I was getting useful lessons
and was made to see that when a commander
cannot get what he wants he must
make the most of what little he has. Indeed,
the delay in getting waggons he could
have done without was, in the end, a calamity
to the general.</p>

<p>The army, over two thousand strong, followed
routes over and through the Alleghanies
which I had used in 1754, and which
could easily have been bettered by free use
of trained scouts and our own axe-men sent
on ahead.</p>

<p>There was much sickness, and the regulars
suffered in many ways by reason of
ignorance and want of knowing how better
to take care of themselves. They complained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
bitterly of the mosquitos, black flies,
and midges, and took so kindly to smudges
that Orme said the smoke was like that the
Israelites had, with less or no trouble.
There was, indeed, some reasonable cause
for complaint by men unused to the woods.
We had twice the worst thunder and lightning
I ever saw. Trees were struck, but
no man, nor ever is in the woods. Three
men died of the bite of rattlesnakes, but few
escaped the little forest bugs called ticks,
which bore into the skin and leave sores
and great itch for weeks. Our rangers undressed
every night and picked off these
pests. The soldiers were too lazy or did
not know enough, and many were lamed
or ulcered for want of such care.</p>

<p>Even before we reached Little Meadows
certain officers saw the danger of our thin
line; more than four miles of it stretched
out across streams and marshes in deep
woods. Had the French been in force we
had certainly been sooner ambushed. Even
the men became uneasy as we entered the
white-pine woods beyond Great Savage
Mountain. Here the deep of the forest was
like twilight, and the trees of great bigness.
When the rangers told the soldiers that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
these dark woods were called the “Shades
of Death,”—but why I do not know,—they
were more alarmed, and were glad about
the 18th to be out of the forest and descending
the shaggy slopes of the Meadow Mountain
to Little Meadows, where was more
light and room to camp.</p>

<p>It was a wonder to us frugal woodsmen
how all this host, cumbered as it was, did at
last get over the hills and reach the Little
Meadows, this being about June 18.</p>

<p>On the evening of our arrival the general
desired me to remain after the other aides
had received orders and gone away. He
then opened his mind to me with great freedom
about the tardiness of the march and
his desire to know what was my opinion
concerning the matter in hand. When he
had made an end of speaking, I said that he
had more men than were needed, but that
to push on in haste was desirable and to
take only the light division, leaving the
heavy troops and most of the baggage.</p>

<p>I begged leave to add that Duquesne was
as yet weakly garrisoned, and the long dry
weather would keep the rivers low, and hard
to navigate by reinforcements from Venango
and the lake, so that if we could dismount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
officers, take to packhorses, and push
on without encumbrance, we could be sure
of an easy victory.</p>

<p>A council of all the field-officers was
called soon after I left the tent; but my
rank not entitling me to be present, I was
pleased to hear from Captain Orme that
the general had stated my views and that
a more rapid march was decided. I was
much disappointed to learn that we were
still to be overburdened with artillery and
waggons. I gave up one of my horses for
a packhorse and saw it no more. Out of two
hundred and twelve horses allowed to officers,
only twelve were thus offered. Why
the general did not order them taken I do
not know.</p>

<p>The force selected was in all about twelve
hundred men and their artillery; but in
place of pushing on with vigour, they must
needs stop to bridge every brook and level
every mole-hill. In four days we marched
only twelve miles.</p>

<p>St. Clair and Colonel Gage were sent on
ahead to clear the way with four hundred
men, and the general followed with eight
hundred. We still moved so slowly that
we were constantly halted because of overtaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
our pioneers. It was up hill and
down, where cannon and waggons had to
be lowered by ropes. There were deep
morasses and constant scares from outlying
parties of Indians.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXV">XXXV</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On the 21st we entered the colony of
Penn, and on the 30th June dropped
down from the hills to Stewart’s Crossing
on the Youghiogheny. Here St. Clair, sent
on in advance, had cleared the ground for
a camp.</p>

<p>We had been all of ten days in marching
twenty-four miles. Day after day, as
Croghan and I uneasily hung about the
flanks and the rear, we saw the long line
of red-coated, cumbered men, sweating in
heavy uniforms, with waggons and cannon,
slowly moving through the silent woods, so
full, to our minds, of peril.</p>

<p>I had been ill for some days, but at the
Youghiogheny River I fell worse of a sudden
with a fever and pain in the head.
The general was most kind and at last ordered
me to remain, leaving me a guard
and my dear Dr. Craik. Colonel Dunbar’s
division had been left behind, to his great
indignation, and was to follow slowly with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
the baggage-train. I was in the utmost
gloom at my detention, being in a way responsible
for the new movement. The
chance to be, by ill luck, laid up while a battle
might take place much disturbed me. I
wrote my brother Jack I would not miss it
for five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>While I lay in bed most impatient, the
detachment went on, and soon after I had
this letter from Christopher Gist, who was
acting as guide:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Respected Sir</span>: We are moving along as solemn
as a box-turtle, one day two miles, which
any smart turtle might compass. The pickets
are doubled, and men sleep with their arms, for,
good Lord! if a branch cracks they give an
alarm, and if a poor devil strays there is a scalp
gone, for every step of our march is watched.
Still I am sure there are no big parties out, for
I have been off in advance and been within half
a mile of the fort, and came nigh to losing my
hair, but with decent good fortune we have the
place. I should be easier with a few hundred of
our own people in the advance and on our skirts,
but they are kept in the rear, the Lord knows
why.</p>
</div>

<p>Captain Orme also wrote to me of frequent
night alarms, and of the general’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
confidence at being now but thirty miles
from the fort. Here two days’ halt was
made to await fresh supplies from Dunbar.</p>

<p>On July 4, being stronger, I started in
the rear of a party of one hundred men
just come up from Colonel Dunbar with
provisions. I was set upon going with
them, but was too weak to ride a horse and
must needs use a waggon. As the road was
much cut up, my bones were almost jolted
through the small cover left on them. On
the 8th I reached the camp, now but thirteen
miles from Duquesne.</p>

<p>My journey took me through the Great
Meadows, near where was my little fight,
and past the ruined palisadoes of Fort Necessity.
I saw them with great interest,
and felt some sense of gratification that now
I might pay up my score against those who
had both humbled and insulted my King
and myself.</p>

<p>Once, as my waggon approached the rear-guard,
we came upon a dozen or more stragglers.
Some had fallen out tired, and some
were loitering to gather berries. I cried out
to warn them of the danger they were in,
and, in fact, about a quarter of an hour later
they ran after us, crying, “Indians!” They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
may have had cause, but all the strange
noises of the woods alarmed them, and this
time the rangers said it was a wildcat.</p>

<p>The sound of distant martial music from
the camps which we were come near to
seemed to revive my mind, and I was able
to cast off the feeling of gloom and converse
with Captain Shirley, the military secretary,
who had ridden back with an order.
He said to me that we had been a month
in marching less than a hundred miles.
Captain Morris, who was with him, said it
was true, but all was well that ended well,
and we had the fort at our mercy and would
attack next day. I advised my friends, as
I had before done, that it would be well if
the officers could be dressed in wood colours,
like our scouts; but Captain Shirley replied
that the general would never allow of it,
and, indeed, when next day I got rid of my
fire-red coat and put on a fringed buckskin
shirt, I was no little jeered at, and Colonel
Gage made some comments, which, I trust,
he came later to regret. I am of opinion
that the absence of a gaudy red coat saved
me from many balls and enabled me to be of
use when the other aides were wounded. I
was much of Mr. Franklin’s opinion that if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
fine feathers make fine birds, they also make
them an easier prey for the fowler.</p>

<p>Indeed, the learned Postmaster-General
made himself very merry over the queues
and the stiff stocks and the bright scarlet
uniforms. He thought the officers only
needed corsets, which I was told they did
often use at home.</p>

<p>When, in the afternoon, very tired and
weak, I reached the tent made ready for me
by the kindness of my brother aides, I lay
down to rest, and, as Captain Morris was
now on duty, I asked him to tell me what
was to be our mode of approach to the fort.
I was able easily to recall the general features
of the country, for the camp was now
set about twelve miles from Frazier’s
former trading-station, where I stopped on
my return from my mission to the French.
We lay some ten miles to the east of the
Monongahela River, and, as was said, thirteen
from Duquesne as the crow flies.</p>

<p>As I rested and we talked, came also Captain
Shirley and Captain Gates of the
Twenty-eighth Regiment, with Stephens,
Hamilton, and Stewart of the Virginians.
Of all of them I was the only man not
killed or wounded in the next day’s battle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
I may well entertain my brother August’s
belief that the conspicuous hand of Providence
was over me, and he must be worse
than an infidel who lacks faith in it.</p>

<p>No thought of to-morrow troubled our
council of war, and we discussed with spirit
what our superiours meant to do. I drew
on a piece of birch bark a rude sketch of
the country. The fort lay on a high bluff
in the angle made by the Ohio and Monongahela
rivers. We were, as I said, some
ten miles to the east of the latter stream and
on the same side as the fort. Between us
and it lay the deep, rugged ravines of Turtle
Creek and the brooks which run into it.
The country beyond it was densely wooded
and without any road. To cross the creek
and cut a road to the fort would be the most
direct way; otherwise we must march to and
cross the Monongahela, a fordable river,
and afterwards move along bluffs three or
four hundred feet high, and follow the
stream for five miles. We should then descend
to the water and arrive at a second
ford; having crossed it, we should be again
on the same side as the fort. Then there
would be before us a slope, and, some two
miles distant, hid in the woods, the bastions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
of Duquesne. Having made clear to my fellow
aides the localities, we considered the
two routes, with some differences of opinion
in regard to which was the better, until they
were called away, and I was left alone.</p>

<p>Soon after came Sir John St. Clair, sent
by the general with a kind message. I then
learned that some effort had been made to
cross Turtle Creek, but that it had been
found impossible to get the artillery over
and that the engineers pronounced it impracticable.
Upon this the general had
given orders to change the route, so that we
should follow the traders’ horse-trail, on
which we had made our road, and should
march to the river. There we were to ford
the stream as I have said, move on the farther
bank some miles, and recross by the
second ford to the east side again, where the
lay of the land allowed, as was supposed,
of an easy approach to the fort.</p>

<p>I was still weak, but although I could
have desired more rest, I walked at dusk
through the great clearing made for the
camp, to report myself at once to the general’s
headquarters. I had been sorry for
his obstinacy and the rudeness he showed
in laughing at our way of fighting, but I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
had been told by Sir Peter Halket that he
had said that Mr. Franklin and Colonel
Washington were the only trustworthy people
he had met in the colonies. I thought
this foolish as showing poor judgment;
but he had been most kind to me, and now,
in spite of all his blunders and our own
failures to supply him promptly, which
were with some justice to be complained of,
we were, as it seemed, on the point of success.</p>

<p>When I presented myself, the general
asked most pleasantly concerning my
health, and if I was well enough to serve
as aide. I assured him I was, but I was
really at the time feeble enough. When I
ventured to make him my compliments on
the near prospect of success before him, he
laughed and asked where had been the need
for our rangers and the tribes of Indians,
and then made me a very fine speech, which
I must admit to having been pleased at.
I ventured to ask leave to go on in the advance
with the Virginia wood-rangers, so
as to secure the pioneers and road-makers
from an ambuscade. He replied shortly:
“Oh, damn your half-drilled rangers! I
shall keep them as a rear-guard.” I rose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
and apologized, feeling that I had been too
forward and had better have held my
tongue. Indeed, I excused myself as well
as I could, and upon this his face cleared,
and he said: “Colonel Gage is to have the
advance, and what would he say to the best
regiment of the King being protected by a
mob of squatters and border farmers. No,
sir; I desire you as my aide.” I said no
more, and returned to my tent.</p>

<p>I have never found that the coming of
decisive events kept me awake when I was
myself the person who had the duty of decision;
but this night, whether from great
fatigue or not, for that does keep a man
from sleep, or that I was still fevered, I
lay awake long, unable to free my mind
from anxious thoughts.</p>

<p>I regretted that I had not asked Mr.
Franklin why at night we heard so many
sounds in the woods which are not heard
by day. No doubt he would have found an
explanation. Long after the camp was at
rest I remained sleepless, hearing the quick
waters of the creek and the noises of the
wood, with the hoot-owl’s cry and the chipmunks
gamboling over the canvas of my
tent, and such stir of the camp as never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
quite ceased. The way we were to march
troubled me and others, especially Sir Peter
Halket, who had forebodings, concerning
which Dr. Mercer had some superstitious
ideas, such as my mother often had, but
which I never entertained, or if as to any,
it is in the way of dreams.</p>

<p>I had reason for my fears, for the two
fords we were to cross could be easily disputed
by a small party. I concluded that
to leave all baggage and artillery to come
later by the fords, and to make a quick and
direct march over the creek and along a
ridge leading to the fort, would be the better
way.</p>

<p>Having settled my mind as to what I
would have done had I been in command, I
disposed myself for sleep, but with no good
result until so late that I heard no reveille
sounded, and was waked by my orderly.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">I do not pretend, even now, to be acquainted
with all the reasons which influenced
the general; but having made up
his mind, we broke camp on the 8th and
marched southwest along a little stream the
scouts called Long Run, and so about eight
miles towards the river Monongahela, being
thus at last two miles from the ford he
meant to cross the next day.</p>

<p>When, in the afternoon about six o’clock,
I was released from duty, I walked through
the camps with Sir Peter Halket. The men
were cleaning their guns and brushing their
clothes and soaping queues and pipe-claying,
all as if for parade and very needless.</p>

<p>Sir Peter, a man of excellent parts and
a good soldier, had expressed himself in the
council as averse to the plan of march.
When he asked after my health and if I
had again regained my strength, I replied
that I was fit for duty, but had been better
if I had been able to sleep. He said with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
gravity that many would sleep soundly to-morrow
and that he was sure he himself
would be killed. This seemed strange to me,
and I could only reply that I did not think
I should be killed, but that we might both
be wrong; and yet both of us were right,
for these matters are in the hands of the
great Disposer of Events, and have never
troubled me on going into battle. One of
my aides in the Revolutionary War, Colonel
Scammel, to whom I was much attached,
did always believe he would be killed, as
indeed happened, at last, to my sorrow, at
Yorktown.</p>

<p>Dr. Craik was with me that evening and
found me chilled and full of aches; but notwithstanding
a potion he gave me, I slept ill
again, and was aroused in the morning by
my good doctor. He advised a glass of rum,
for which I felt the better, and when I had
eaten and was in the saddle I repaired to
where was General Braddock, a short distance
from the shore. He was in a gay humour
and very kind, asking if I felt well
and would drink with him to the King that
evening in the French fort. I could do no
more than reply that to do so would give
me great pleasure. I was presently sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
down to the shore with a message, and there
saw Colonel Gage crossing the shallow ford
to some open meadow-lands on the farther
side. He was to secure the two fords by
which the whole force following him was to
cross and then recross, so as to be again
on the same side of the river as Fort Duquesne.
After him, about four o’clock,
came Sir John St. Clair, with carpenters—or,
as we should say, axemen—and engineers,
some three hundred in all.</p>

<p>I lingered a few moments and saw the
last of the advance, as they marched up
from the farther bank of the river and their
red coats disappeared into the forest beyond
the ford, which was, I thought, well
chosen and shallow.</p>

<p>Before I went back, Gist, the trader, and
Captain Croghan came to speak to me. I
remarked that we had done well to come
so far without more trouble from the Indians.
Gist laughed and said: “They have
never left us since we dropped you at the
Youghiogheny.” Then Croghan cried out,
“There they are,” and there was a sound
of musketry beyond the river. It proved
to be a small body of savages, easily dispersed
by Gage. It being then about six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
o’clock <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the signal to fall in, which we
call the “general,” was beat, and the main
body fell in with fresh cartridges.</p>

<p>The officers were in full uniform, and so,
with fixed bayonets and colours flying and
the drums beating the Grenadier’s March,
they waded the stream.</p>

<p>I sat in the saddle with the two aides,
Captains Orme and Morris, and with the interest
of a young soldier watched this fine
body of men fall in with perfect discipline
on the further side and disappear in their
turn. This being the main body, the staff
followed with the general, and I was sent
back to hasten up the rangers, who had the
rear. I found them about two hundred and
thirty strong, moving slowly, most in hunting-shirts
and fur caps and moccasins. A
part were thrown out far to right and left
in the woods. Ensign Allen and an officer
whose name I forget appeared to be in command,
and were vainly endeavouring to
keep up some of the military order they had
been teaching. I thought them wanting in
sense and wished I had the rangers at the
front. I gave my message and left them.
Then I made haste to ride back to the ford,
which was still held by a small guard. Here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
I waited, as I was ordered to do, to see the
rear well over and into the woods. After
crossing the ford I found that a rough road
had been cleared by the French along the
shore, and hurried through the woods beside
the moving column to report.</p>

<p>It was noon before we got to the second
ford, above where Turtle Creek empties
into the river; and, after much delay with
the artillery, we got over, I think a little after
one o’clock, as fine a sight as ever I saw.
Here, before us, were some open meadows
about a quarter-mile wide, and, twenty feet
above the ford, a fair road leading upward
over a little stream called Frazier’s Run,
and into the woods. Very quickly, the aides
carrying messages at need, the men were
got into marching orders. For a full quarter
of a mile there were bottom-lands in two
easy rises, and beyond these the ground rose
amid long grass, very dry, and thick bushes,
great rocks, and trunks of fallen trees, which
the garrison must have felled for fuel.</p>

<p>Long afterwards I rode over this field
and saw better the trap into which we fell.
On both sides of the road, which was broad
and much used, the ground rose, and here,
where the wood was more dense, amid thick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
underwood, were ravines, some very deep
and others only five or six feet. These gullies
lay among great trees, pines and gum,
and a tangle of grape-vines, brambles, and
Indian plums. One long and deeper ravine
was the bed of a little creek, and on the right
of the road the ground rose quite steep.
Further on, as I saw at the time, for the advance
was slow, I observed that the woods
seemed to show a series of low hills, and
beyond them no greater rise of land to the
fort, which was hid some seven miles away,
at the junction of the rivers; nor did we
ever have sight of it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we of the main body, halting
now and then, marched slowly up from the
ford towards the deeper woods, losing sight
of the advance as it entered the forest, and
quite ignorant of the ravines, or of an enemy,
so hid were they in the underbrush.</p>

<p>The main body halted in the mid-space,
where the battle was later engaged, so that
we lay for the time just on the second bottom.
By this time Colonel Gage was far
in front with guides and engineers, engaging
in the woods, and Sir John St. Clair,
with his working-party of pioneers, axemen,
and grenadiers, followed. All was very orderly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
with flanking-parties thrown out on
both sides, but not, to my mind, far enough.
Orme wrote me afterwards, when he had
learned better, “It was all as if for a fine
review in St. James’s Park.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXVII">XXXVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">At this time, as I said, I was with General
Braddock on the upper bottom. I
considered that between the place where the
three hundred men of the advance were entering
the thicker woods, and the ford,
might have been about six hundred perches.
I took out my watch and saw that it was ten
minutes to two, the rear being yet crossing
or in the river. As I turned to look forward,
heavy firing broke out far away in
the woods and among the rocks and bushes.
I knew too well the Indian yells. Very soon
I could see men falling and others dropping
back. Orme rode forward to get some account
for the general. In a few minutes he
returned, badly wounded in the left arm.
Sir John still advancing, the general ordered
Colonel Burton, of the main van, forward
with eight hundred men. There was
now thick smoke about the advance on the
edge of the deeper wood, and amid yells and
cries the whole of what was left of the pioneers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
and their guard fell back out of the
woods, at first a few, and then many, and
down the upper slope, somewhat disordering
Sir John’s supporting party.</p>

<p>Sir Peter Halket was told to remain with
four hundred men as a baggage-guard, and
the general rode forward himself with Colonel
Burton’s eight hundred men, ordering
a bayonet charge of a party up the hill on
our right, whence came so hot a fire from
unseen enemies that the officers were at once
killed, and the men fell back at a run.</p>

<p>For some time Sir John’s force behaved
with great courage and let the broken pioneers
pass through their lines, but could
never be got to go farther, and stood stupidly
firing into the wood. At last, as the
officers fell, the advance became more
broken and began to retreat slowly, but at
last running, until they were mixed up with
Colonel Burton’s reinforcement.</p>

<p>I never saw in my later warfare worse
confusion nor a hotter fire, nor men better
hid, for the savages and French lay in the
ravines among the brush and picked off the
mounted officers, or fired into the masses
of men with no need to take accurate aim.</p>

<p>More and more the rear was forced forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
to support the retreating troops; but
as none of them could see any enemy and
were falling every moment from the fire, a
general panic took place among the men,
from which no exertion on the part of the
officers could recover them. In the early
part of the action some of the irregulars, as
they were called, without directions, advanced
to the right, in loose order, to attack;
but this, unhappily, from the unusual
appearance of the movement, being mistaken
for cowardice and a running away,
was discountenanced.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that even then if the
general had remained on the cleared ground
below and there rallied the men, where was
open space and on the sides little cover, the
day might have been saved, as the small
French and Indian force would never have
left the woods. He, however, pushed on in
person, urging an advance, and sent Captain
Morris to order up Sir Peter Halket
and the rear-guard. We were now caught
on both sides among ravines, great rocks,
and trees, where on our front and on both
flanks the enemy spread out in the woods.
The more of our force came up from the
rear, the easier was the slaughter. At this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
time, when it was not yet too late, amid
the confusion which became more and more
general, I made an offer to head the provincials
and engage the enemy in their own
way; but the general would not listen or
perhaps did not hear, for the noise was
great. At all events, the propriety of it was
not seen until it was too late for execution.
Whether he heard me or not, I cannot say.
What with our regulars shooting at random,
the replies from the ravines and woods, the
orders of officers, the yells of the Indians,
and the cries of the wounded, there was a
confusedness fit to turn any man’s head.
When the soldiers tried to take wood shelter,
as was proper and reasonable, the general
and their officers cursed them for cowards
and struck them with the flat of their
swords. The poor dogs tried to obey their
leaders, and again and again formed into
platoons, facing to left or right, thus making
them only the easier to kill. I saw Captain
Orme of the artillery fall dead as they
rode up with the cannon, and the engineer,
Captain Henry Gordon, dropped wounded,
but got up and did, I believe, succeed to
reach the ford.</p>

<p>The men with the swivels stood to it well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
in giving some shots, and then gave way,
most of them tumbling almost in heaps.
Seeing this, I dismounted with two other
officers, and made a man hold my horse,
and aided to fire into the ravine on the
right; but the few men left who should have
helped to serve the piece soon dropped, hurt
or dead, and seeing I could no further assist,
I mounted again and turned out of the
broken ranks to encourage the Virginia
rangers, who were running up without orders
and spreading out to right and left, taking
shelter wherever was a tree or rock, all
most gallant and well done. Although the
turmoil was such as I cannot describe, there
were many brave efforts to rally and to
carry the high ground above our right. All
this lasted fully an hour or more, for at
times, discipline prevailing, orders were
given to storm the flanking slopes, and constantly
failed to be effectual, for, as the
officers were picked off, the men ran back
to the main body.</p>

<p>The smoke was by this time so thick as
somewhat to obscure all things at a distance,
but a sudden wind, arising, cleared it away,
and I saw that we were giving way more
and more, the whole body of the force moving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
slowly down the slope. As I looked
about me in despair, my horse fell and rolled
over dead. By good fortune I had learned
in fox-hunting how to fall clear. In a moment
I was up, and saw that the troops were
scattered in detachments and firing at random,
or vainly trying in groups to follow
their officers, who were shot down mercilessly.
I saw Captain Shirley, the general’s
secretary, fall dead. He was quite close
to me, and amidst all this tumult his horse
stood still, and, to my amazement, began to
eat the grass. I caught the beast and
mounted. I hardly knew what to do. The
Virginians were being shot by the regulars,
who knew no more than to fire wherever
they saw smoke from behind a tree or bush.
As to orders, there were at this time none,
and, indeed, until just above the river, no
sufficient space to move in without taking to
the woods.</p>

<p>I tried to help the general and the few
left of the officers in their efforts to effect
an orderly retreat. I have heard that five
horses were shot under him. This I was told
by Captain Morris, and it is no doubt true,
for the horse is a large object and easy
to hit. Few officers were left alive, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
those who were unhurt could not get the
regulars to obey a command. What was left
of twelve hundred men were huddled together
in groups in and out of the woods,
as I have seen sheep in a storm.</p>

<p>The general showed great courage, and
made many efforts in person to rally the
men or get them to retreat in an orderly
way. He was carried down the slope with
the rout, but remained as obstinate as ever
as to the way of fighting, insisting on the
men re-forming. Sir Peter Halket, Morris,
and I vainly entreated him to order the
soldiers to take shelter as the rangers did.
As Sir Peter spoke, he dropped dead. His
son, the captain, dismounted to help him,
and fell dead on his father’s body.</p>

<p>I have never seen a man who could describe
what took place in the midst of a
battle, nor can I pretend to greater accuracy.
I remember that after two hours or more I
became suddenly sure that all was lost. The
whole disordered mass now broke and ran
as sheep before hounds, leaving artillery,
provisions, baggage, and the wounded and
dying—in short, everything. When finally
a dozen gallant officers threw themselves in
front, they were knocked down and trampled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
on. We had as little success as if we
had attempted to stop the wild bears of the
mountains, or torrents, with our feet. It
was quite useless.</p>

<p>At this time General Braddock was under
a great oak near to where we left the waggons.
I was beside him and heard him cry
out, “They have got me.” Captain Stewart,
of the Virginia light guard, caught him as he
reeled in the saddle, shot through the right
arm and lung. The men ran past us, refusing
to help; but another officer aiding, we
somehow got him on to a small covered cart,
and he was carried along in what was now
a mad flight to get to the ford. I heard him
cry out: “Let me alone. Let me die here.”</p>

<p>The waggoners in our rear near the ford
cut loose the traces and mounted their
horses and fled. In spite of the great courage
shown by the officers, who in camp were
drunken or seemed to be effeminate or
lazy, all who were of mind to resist were
swept away by a mere mob of panic-struck
men. Men caught on to my stirrups, and
even the horse’s mane, but somehow I got
free and out again to one side. Instantly
my second horse staggered and went down.
I saw Dr. Craik, near by, with the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
devotion, although himself wounded, helping
a disabled officer to walk away. I was
now afoot, and, as I saw how complete was
the rout, I began to fear that our brave Virginians
would none of them escape. They
held the fringe of the woods with wonderful
courage, using their rifles, and keeping
back the French and Indians. Nothing else
saved the troops of his Majesty from complete
massacre.</p>

<p>As I stood still a moment I heard Croghan
call loudly to me to take to cover. I
took his advice, and God alone knows how
I escaped death. I had four balls through
my clothes.</p>

<p>The leaders of the rangers now saw how
great was their peril. The regulars were by
this time near the ford, in the river, or across
and far beyond it. A few brave men in
groups were retreating slowly, firing useless
shots. The enemy, yelling in triumph, were
crawling or leaping nearer from time to time.
Now and then a painted savage ran out from
cover and fled back, shaking a bloody scalp.</p>

<p>The rangers had lost heavily, but those
who were left slipped from one shelter to
another, and at last, when there was little
cover left, ran down to the river, and I with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
them. Few would have got away except
for the desire of the Indians to plunder the
dead and the baggage and to collect scalps,
and that the French were too few in number
to venture on pursuit.</p>

<p>I got over the ford in haste, and standing
still on the rise of ground beyond the
river, looked at my watch. I could hardly
believe it to be, as I saw, five o’clock. Most
of those who were unhurt were now safe, and
with Captain Croghan I began to gather the
wreck of our poor rangers. One company
was almost all gone; another lost every officer
and many men. As to the regulars,
seven hundred, nearly half of the force, were
dead or wounded. A part of what was left
of this fine army was soon scattered beyond
the two fords, and later was starved in the
woods or got at last into the camps.</p>

<p>About a hundred men were gathered by
the officers a quarter of a mile beyond our
first ford. Lieutenant-Colonel Burton rallied
some hundreds of men, and later about
eighty, under Colonel Gage, joined them.
To my relief, and greatly to my surprise,
there was no pursuit. We pushed on with
the wounded general, and at last, as night
fell, camped in much discomfort.</p>

<p class="cap">That night the parties and sentinels
thrown out deserted in an hour. Although
very weak, I sat up beside the general
all night. Dr. Craik, who had cared for
his wound in the lung, assured me that he
would certainly die before dawn; but he
lived longer than was expected. I never remember
having been more disturbed in
mind than during that night.</p>

<p>We all sat up, armed, in or about the
rude shelter which held General Braddock,
and talked in whispers sadly of the battle.
Captain Montresor and also Captain Gordon
of the engineers, who gave the first
alarm, and who was severely wounded, declared
to me that so complete were the shelters
that he never saw so much as a half-dozen
of the enemy. We could only lament
the fate of the wounded left on the field,
for the French made later no return of prisoners.
Every moment I expected to hear
the yells of the Indians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p>At break of day we rigged a kind of litter
and got away, being soon joined, to my relief,
by Colonel Gage, who was severely
contused, and his eighty men. I caught here
a stray waggon-horse and rode him, with a
rope bridle and no saddle but a blanket.</p>

<p>As we pushed on through the woods, Colonel
Gage talked with me at length of the
disaster. He made many excuses for the
soldiers, as that they had been worn out by
labour on the way, had no rum, and were
disheartened by the tales our rangers had
told them of the Indians.</p>

<p>Indeed, I fear it was true that the Virginians
amused themselves with talk about
legions of rattlesnakes, bears, and scalping.
Croghan said the regulars were babes in
the woods and quite as helpless. I made
answer to the colonel that but for our rangers
few of his Majesty’s men would have
seen their homes, and that the soldiers had
behaved like poltroons. He said that was
true, and after this we walked our horses
on through the woods in silence, the rangers
ahead.</p>

<p>I met this officer again in 1773, when,
being a general, he was entertained at dinner
by the citizens of New York. At this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
time the freedom of the city of New York
was presented to him in a gold box having
on it the arms of that city, and below, those
of the King.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Our final intercourse was by
letter, when he was besieged in Boston and
I felt it needful to remonstrate upon his
treatment of prisoners.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Now in the possession of Lord Rosebery.</p>

</div>

<p>So many officers were wounded that, early
on the day after the battle, although very
weak, it fell to me, having at last been better
horsed, to carry orders to the force we had
left forty miles in our rear.</p>

<p>With a half-dozen horse I rode on all
night in a drizzle of rain, and so all the next
day, very melancholy and ready to drop
with fatigue. Indeed, I fell down as I dismounted
when I rode in to Colonel Dunbar’s
camp, and was only revived by a little
spirits and a good meal.</p>

<p>The whole force which we had left here
were more scared, I believe, than those who
had been in the battle; for the runaway
waggoners told terrible stories, and it was
with great difficulty that this division of the
army was kept from flying.</p>

<p>The shocking scenes which presented
themselves in this march to Dunbar’s camp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
are not to be described: the dead, the dying,
the groans, the lamentations and cries
for help of the wounded along the road (for
those who were hurt endeavoured, from
the first commencement of the action, or
rather the confusion, to escape to the second
division), were enough to pierce a
heart of adamant. Our trouble was not
a little increased by the impervious darkness
occasioned by the thick woods, which
rendered it almost impossible for the guides
to know when they were in or out of the
track except by groping on the ground
with their hands to find the way. It was
happy for the wreck of the foremost division
that they left such a quantity of
valuable and enticing baggage on the field
as to occasion a scramble and contention
in the seizure and distribution of it among
the enemy; for if a pursuit had taken place
by passing directly across the deep defiles
of Turtle Creek, which General Braddock
had avoided, they would have got into our
rear, and then the whole, except a few
woodsmen, would have fallen victims to
the merciless savages.</p>

<p>The provisions and waggon needed for
the general were made ready during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
night, and at break of day, with two companies
of grenadiers, I rode back again,
hardly knowing if I should drop on the
road. I met the general at Gist’s cabin,
some thirteen miles away. On our return
we halted half a day at Dunbar’s camp, and
then hurried on with his force to Great
Meadows, where we camped on the 13th of
July. There were, as some of us believed,
still men enough, if fitly handled, to return
and surprise the French; but, as Gist said,
these men were already defeated, and no
one of those in command meant to try it
again. Indeed, Dunbar intended for Philadelphia
and to wait there for reinforcements.
Even Governor Dinwiddie would
have had him make a new campaign; but
they had all of them had, as Dr. Craik said,
a big dose of Indian medicine, and a council
decided with the colonel. The governor
was much troubled when he heard of this
decision, and, as he told me later, wrote to
Lord Halifax that he would have now not
only to guard the border, but to protect the
counties from combinations of negro
slaves, who had become, Governor Dinwiddie
declared, audacious since General Braddock’s
defeat, because the poor creatures believed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
the French would give them their
freedom. My wounded general’s proud
spirit gave way when he heard of Colonel
Dunbar’s intention. He lived four days
after the battle, having been brought in
much pain, and still more distress of mind,
to the camp at Great Meadows.</p>

<p>For the most part he was silent and only
now and then let a groan. Dr. Craik told
me that he cried out over and over: “Who
would have believed it possible?” Once he
said to Captain Stewart: “We shall know
better next time; but what will the duke
say? [That was his Grace of Cumberland.]
What will he say?” On the morning of
the 13th Dr. Craik said the general had
made his will and desired to see me. When
he was aware of my coming into his hut,
he put out his left hand, saying, “That is
the only hand which is left,” for the ball
had gone through his right arm. He was
said to be a great wit, but that a man about
to die should have spirit to use his dying
breath in a jest much astonished me.</p>

<p>He said: “I want you to take my horse
and my man, Bishop. I have told St.
Clair.” Then he said: “I should have taken
your advice. Too late; too late.” After<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
this he closed his eyes, and again, after a
little, opened them and said feebly: “If I
lived I should never wish to see a red coat
again. My compliments to the governor.”
He spoke no more, only, “How they will
curse me!” and I went out. In fact, I was
too weak to endure the deadly sorrow with
which this brave man’s miserable end afflicted
me, to whom he had been so kind a
friend.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to distract my mind by examining
the remains of the fort I had here
made. To my amazement, I saw, as I moved
about, that there was little discipline, and I
observed that where there is too much drill
and mechanical order a defeat does away
with it entirely. The colonials it was hard
to instruct; but as every man was used to
rely on himself at any minute, and not to
look all the time for orders, they suffered
less during disaster, and on a retreat knew
how to care for themselves. Now the few
that were left looked on with wonder at the
stupid destruction of waggons, provisions,
and even artillery. Many of the officers
were disgusted, and protested against these
disgraceful proceedings.</p>

<p>But Colonel Dunbar meant to move on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
to Philadelphia, as he said, for winter quarters,
and yet now it was only July, and he
had men enough left to guard the frontier
or to return and take the fort.</p>

<p>I felt sick and worn out, and soon went
to my shelter among the Virginians. I
threw myself down and fell into a deep
sleep, and indeed never stirred until Captain
Walter Stewart had to shake me to
wake me up. I must have dreamed, for he
told me I had called out “Indians” twice.</p>

<p>When I was well awakened, he said: “We
are to move at once. Every frog that croaks
and every screech-owl is an Indian for these
whipped curs. The general died at twelve
o’clock. He is to be buried in the roadway,
so that the red devils may not dig up his
scalp. Colonel Dunbar asks that you will
read the service.”</p>

<p>I thought the request strange until he reminded
me, as indeed I knew, that the chaplain,
Mr. Hamilton, who had behaved with
good sense and courage in the action, was
badly wounded, and that the colonel, who
was the proper person for this sad business,
was occupied in arranging for the march
and in destroying what had been gathered
at such great cost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>It was just before break of day I went
out after Stewart, feeling a kind of satisfaction
that the coward in command was
not to commit to the grave my poor general,
whom, being dead, every one would
abuse.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XXXIX">XXXIX</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">If I had the pen of a good writer I should
incline to describe what I saw. There
were great fires burning, and all manner
of baggage and stores thrown on them. The
regulars were chopping up the artillery-waggons
and casting ammunition into a
creek.</p>

<p>About a hundred yards away from my
hut, in the middle of the road, a deep grave
was dug. A few officers and men were gathered
about it, and on the ground lay the
general’s body, wrapt in a cloak, but no
coffin. I looked about me, not knowing how
to conduct the matter. Then an orderly
handed me the chaplain’s prayer-book, with
a marker at the funeral service.</p>

<p>As I was about to begin, Lieutenant-Colonel
Burton came forward with a flag and
laid it decently over the dead man. Then he
placed on it his sword, and fell back, and all
uncovered. After this I read slowly, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
light was yet dim, the service of the church.
This being over, the men lowered the body
into the grave and filled it up with earth,
and cast stones and bushes over it. No
guard was ordered, and no volley fired, lest,
as was said, it might be heard by the enemy,
which appeared to me foolish, for there was
noise enough, and at any minute one hundred
men in the woods would have routed
the whole camp.</p>

<p>Thus died a man whose good and bad
qualities were intimately blended. He was
brave even to a fault and in regular service
would have done honour to the army. His
attachments were warm, his enmities were
strong, and, having no disguise about him,
both appeared in full force. He was generous
and disinterested, but plain and blunt
in his manner, even to rudeness.</p>

<p>Dunbar made haste to get away, and I was
not less pleased to be out of an ill-contrived
business.</p>

<p>This affair was a serious blow to the belief
in the colonies as to the high value of
the King’s soldiers. It became like a proverb
in Virginia to say a man “ran like a
regular.”</p>

<p>Mr. Franklin said to me long afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
that this disaster gave us the first suspicion
that our exalted ideas of the powers of British
regular troops had not been well
founded, and indeed I am assured that when
Lord Percy’s and Colonel Pitcairn’s force
was put to flight at Lexington the older
farmers on our own frontiers, when they
knew what had been done, were less amazed
than the minute-men of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>We reached Wills Creek on the 18th, as
Morris said, the worst-beaten army that
had not been in battle. Colonel Dunbar did
not require my aid, and my general being
dead, my service as a volunteer was at an
end.</p>

<p>The march to the settlements was most
disgraceful—all in cowardly haste to get
out of the wilderness. I am satisfied that
no troops are so given to pillage as a retreating
army, and certainly none was ever
worse conducted by the officers or more
disorderly than Colonel Dunbar’s force.
The settlers and outlying farms near Fort
Cumberland suffered much; men and
women were misused, and chickens and cattle
stolen. I heard afterwards that in their
march through Pennsylvania Dunbar’s men
plundered and insulted the farmers still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
worse, and were quite enough, Mr. Franklin
said, to put us out of all patience with such
defenders.</p>

<p>I bade good-by to the aides of the general,
and would have had Orme and Morris go
home with me to be cared for by Dr. Craik,
but they preferred to go on to Philadelphia.
They were much dispirited, but had only
warm praise for my Virginia rangers. I
was in no better humour, and felt, as I rode
away, that we were on the edge of an awful
crisis for the border counties. The favourable
sentiments Sir John St. Clair and Colonel
Burton were pleased to express respecting
me could not but be pleasing; but the
situation of our affairs was, to my mind, so
serious as to put me into one of my melancholic
moods and to make me feel, as I often
did in the greater war, that, what with want
of patriotism and lack of spirit, only that
Providence in which I have always trusted
could carry us through a great peril. As
usual, a brisk ride jolted me into a more
hopeful state of mind.</p>

<p>I lay for a day at Winchester in a poor
tavern, cared for by the general’s man,
Bishop. There, to my comfort, came Lord
Fairfax, who had the kindness to bring with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
him a good horse, which I was the better
pleased to have because what became of
the horse the general would have had me
have I was never able to hear. His lordship
insisted that I rest at Greenway Court until
I was more fit to travel. I had here many
letters; one said that I was given up for
killed, and there was come a long story
about my dying speech. My mother was in
a sad worry about me, and when she received
my letter contradicting my death,
and that I had never composed any dying
speech, she declared I was always making
her anxious and had no right to distress her
by doing things that gave her occasion to
think I was dead. His lordship overcame
my objections, and I remained with him
at the court several days, well pleased to be
at rest.</p>

<p>When alone with Lord Fairfax, he
showed me the affection and concern which,
like myself, he was averse to displaying in
company. After I had been made to give
him a full account of the march and the battle,
he said: “You will be wise to write and
to say little of what took place, and to let
others say what they will. The men who,
having done something worthy of praise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
do not incline to speak of it, are sure to be
enough spoken of by others.”</p>

<p>This was much as in any case I inclined
to do, so that until now I have nowhere
related this matter at length, and, as to the
diary kept on our march, the French had it,
and I saved only two or three letters.</p>

<p>What his lordship wrote of this disastrous
business and of me to his friends in
London, I do not know, but I was soon
aware that both in England and in the colonies
I was more praised than I deserved
to be.</p>

<p>In 1758, a second British force, under
Colonel Grant, was defeated in like manner
as Braddock had been, but this was at
the outworks of Fort Duquesne. In November
of that same year I served under
General Forbes and saw once more this disastrous
neighbourhood. The hillside where
we suffered such disgraceful and needless
defeat was a miserable sight, for there were
here scattered bits of red uniform and the
bones of men and horses bleached in the
sun.</p>

<p>At this time the garrison had fled, after
succeeding in part to burn the fort, but no
great damage done. I myself raised the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
flag of his Majesty over the ruins which
had cost the lives of so many brave men.</p>

<p>I lingered longer at Greenway Court than
was needful to repair my broken health,
for what his lordship had to say of men
and of passing events I found instructive,
and the counsels he gave to agree with my
own disposition.</p>

<p>I received here a letter from my mother,
entreating me not to engage further in the
military line, but giving no good reasons,
so that I had to reply that she should more
consider my honour and what duty I owed
to my country than to grieve over what
might not result in misfortune, or if it did,
was to be accepted as better for me than to
have failed to be worthy of the esteem of
just men. When I spoke of this letter to
Lord Fairfax, he said I had answered with
entire propriety.</p>

<p>I reached Mount Vernon, as my diary
shows, on July 26, at 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, a poorer man
for my campaigning, and, I feared, with a
good constitution much impaired.</p>

<p>Soon after I returned I received several
letters congratulating me on my escape unhurt,
and expressing a general satisfaction
that amidst so much cowardice and ill management<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
the rangers behaved with spirit
and courage.</p>

<p>Among these communications one which
afforded me more than ordinary pleasure
was from Mr. Benjamin Franklin. Besides
what he found fit to say of me, were certain
reflections which, at this distant day, seem
to nourish my inclination to look forward
now, as he did then, desirous, as all must
be, to discern from the present what the
future alone can surely disclose.</p>

<p>Indeed, as I have descended the vale of
life I have had increasing need to consider
what the years would bring about, for to
endeavour to forecast the future is one of
the duties of a statesman.</p>

<p>Mr. Franklin, when in his last illness, said
to General Knox, who spoke of it to Mrs.
Washington, that I possessed the capacity
to look forward in a way which, he said,
was one of the forms of imagination, but
that I had not the gift of fancy. I am not
assured even now that I fully understand
what he desired to convey by this statement.</p>

<p>The letter which gave rise in my mind to
these reflections contains one of those light
statements which I have never found myself
able to employ, and which do not assist me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
to understand the affair in hand, or to comprehend
any better what is desired to be
conveyed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><i>Philadelphia.</i></p>

<p class="noi">To Colonel George Washington.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Respected Sir</span>: I am the richer for having
had the opportunity of making your acquaintance,
and I ought not to conceal from you the
pleasure I have had in learning of late that your
conduct in the humiliating defeat of General
Braddock was such as to be a matter of just
pride to the colonies.</p>

<p>Affairs with us, and indeed with all the colonies,
are in a condition greatly to be deplored.
We are, as it appears to me, much in the same
state as a man I knew who, having married four
times, had as a consequence four mothers-in-law,
all of whom were of opinion that they had the
right to meddle in his family affairs. These are,
for us, the King, the Parliament, the Lords of
Trade, and the Governors. For all of them we
are a family of bad little boys. We, on the other
hand, entertain the belief that we are grown-up
Englishmen, who believe that we inherit certain
rights. Soon or late mischief will come of it.
The eggs of trouble are slow to hatch, but they
do surely hatch soon or late and are never
addled.</p>

<p>It would be worse than folly to conceal from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
you my fears as to the future. There are limitations
to what men like our colonists, accustomed
to a large measure of individual freedom,
will endure. We seem to me to have gone back
a century and to be at the commencement of just
such a struggle with the crown as then occurred.</p>

<p>I was interested in what you said of the great
coldness of a spring at Mount Vernon. I will,
when opportunity serves, send you a good thermometer,
when I think you will find that your
wells have near about what is the average heat
of the air for the entire year.</p>

<p>I hope to hear from you at your convenience,
and, believe me, I shall feel myself honoured by
any such mark of your attention, and that I am,
with respect,</p>

<p>I gave this almanac and the letter to be
read to my Lord Fairfax. He returned
them, saying that what was said of the way
of governing the colonies was true, but that
Mr. Franklin overstated what was to be
feared in the future; and as to the almanac,
damn the man’s little maxims! They smelt
of New England.</p>

<p>In the evening felt somewhat a lowness of

have never had the inclination to set down
in my diary other than practical matters.
To distract my thoughts, I began to run
over what was wrote last year and to consider
of what has passed since I wrote, and
of what must be done with what was written.
My late brother Charles dying in September,
I am the only male left of the
second marriage. We are no long-lived
people, and when I shall be called to follow
them is known only to the Giver of Life.
When the summons comes, I shall endeavour
to obey it with a good grace.</p>

<p>I have had much anxiety during the past
two years concerning my country, and especially
as to the indignities inflicted on us
by the French, and a certain relief not to be
again called, at my age, into the field. I
may have been too anxious, but a bystander
sees more of the game than they who are
playing, and I believe I have had cause to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
feel uneasy. But the Ship of State is afloat,
or very nearly so, and, considering myself
as a passenger only, I shall trust to Heaven

us into a safe port of peace and prosperity.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
